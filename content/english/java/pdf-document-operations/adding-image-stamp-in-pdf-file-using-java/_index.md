```java
// Code to add an image stamp
Stamp stamp = new Stamp();
stamp.bindImage("path/to/your/image.png");
pdfDocument.getPages().get_Item(1).addStamp(stamp);
```

## Step 5: Customize the Image Stamp

You can customize the appearance and position of the image stamp according to your requirements. Adjust the opacity, size, rotation, and other properties as needed.
