## Introduction to Drawing Line Across the Page in PDF with Java

Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful API that allows developers to work with PDF documents in their Java applications. In this step-by-step guide, we will explore how to draw a line across the page in a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for Java. Whether you want to add decorative lines, separate sections, or highlight content, this tutorial will show you how to do it with ease.

## Getting Started with Aspose.PDF for Java

Before we dive into the code, make sure you have Aspose.PDF for Java installed in your project. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/java/) and follow the installation instructions provided on the site.

## Adding Aspose.PDF to Your Project

To add Aspose.PDF to your Java project, you'll need to include the library in your dependencies. Here's how you can do it using Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-pdf</artifactId>
    <version>21.5</version> <!-- Replace with the latest version -->
</dependency>
```

If you're using a different build tool, refer to the documentation for the appropriate setup.

## Creating a New PDF Document

Now, let's start by creating a new PDF document using Aspose.PDF for Java. Here's a basic code snippet to get you started:

```java
import com.aspose.pdf.Document;

public class CreatePDF {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a new Document
        Document doc = new Document();
    }
}
```

## Drawing a Line Across the Page

To draw a line across the page, you can use the `Line` class provided by Aspose.PDF. Here's an example of how to draw a simple horizontal line:

```java
import com.aspose.pdf.*;

public class DrawLine {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a new Document
        Document doc = new Document();
        
        // Create a page
        Page page = doc.getPages().add();
        
        // Create a line object
        Line line = new Line(new float[] { 100, 100, 400, 100 });
        
        // Add the line to the page
        page.getParagraphs().add(line);
    }
}
```

This code creates a PDF document with a horizontal line starting at coordinates (100, 100) and ending at (400, 100). You can adjust the coordinates and line properties as needed.

## Customizing the Line

Aspose.PDF for Java provides various properties to customize the line's appearance, such as line color, width, and style. Here's how you can change the line color and width:

```java
// Customize the line
line.setColor(Color.getRed());
line.getGraphInfo().setLineWidth(2);
```

Feel free to explore other properties and styles to match your requirements.

## Saving the PDF Document

Once you've added the line and customized it, you can save the PDF document to a file. Here's how to do it:

```java
doc.save("output.pdf");
```

Congratulations! You've successfully drawn a line across the page in a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for Java.

## FAQs

### How do I add a vertical line to my PDF document?

To add a vertical line, simply adjust the coordinates when creating the `Line` object. For example, to add a vertical line starting at (200, 100) and ending at (200, 400), modify the coordinates as follows:

```java
Line verticalLine = new Line(new float[] { 200, 100, 200, 400 });
```

### Can I change the line style to be dashed?

Yes, you can change the line style to dashed by setting the line's dash pattern. Here's an example:

```java
line.getGraphInfo().getDashArray().add(2f);
line.getGraphInfo().getDashArray().add(2f);
```

This will create a dashed line with a pattern of 2 units on, 2 units off.

### Is Aspose.PDF for Java compatible with Java 8?

Yes, Aspose.PDF for Java is compatible with Java 8 and later versions. Ensure that you have the appropriate version of the library for your Java environment.

### How can I add text above the line I've drawn?

To add text above the line, you can use the `TextFragment` class provided by Aspose.PDF. Create a `TextFragment` object and add it to the page.

### Where can I find more examples and documentation for Aspose.PDF for Java?

You can find comprehensive documentation and more examples on the Aspose.PDF for Java documentation page: [here](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/).
