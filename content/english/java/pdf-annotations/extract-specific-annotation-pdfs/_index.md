## Introduction

Annotations in PDFs can be a treasure trove of information. They allow users to add comments, highlight important sections, and even attach custom notes. However, sometimes you may need to extract specific annotations for reporting or analysis purposes. Aspose.PDF for Java makes this task easier with its comprehensive set of features.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Aspose.PDF for Java library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/java/).

## Setting Up the Project

To get started, create a new Java project and add the Aspose.PDF for Java library to your project's dependencies.

```java
// Add Aspose.PDF dependency to your project
dependencies {
    implementation group: 'com.aspose', name: 'aspose-pdf', version: '21.12'
}
```

## Loading a PDF Document

```java
// Load a PDF document
Document pdfDocument = new Document("sample.pdf");
```

## Extracting Text Annotations

```java
// Extract text annotations
for (Annotation annotation : pdfDocument.getPages().get_Item(1).getAnnotations()) {
    if (annotation instanceof TextAnnotation) {
        TextAnnotation textAnnotation = (TextAnnotation) annotation;
        System.out.println("Text Annotation: " + textAnnotation.getContents());
    }
}
```

## Extracting Highlight Annotations

```java
// Extract highlight annotations
for (Annotation annotation : pdfDocument.getPages().get_Item(1).getAnnotations()) {
    if (annotation instanceof HighlightAnnotation) {
        HighlightAnnotation highlightAnnotation = (HighlightAnnotation) annotation;
        System.out.println("Highlight Annotation: " + highlightAnnotation.getContents());
    }
}
```

## Extracting Custom Annotations

```java
// Extract custom annotations
for (Annotation annotation : pdfDocument.getPages().get_Item(1).getAnnotations()) {
    if (annotation instanceof RubberStampAnnotation) {
        RubberStampAnnotation customAnnotation = (RubberStampAnnotation) annotation;
        System.out.println("Custom Annotation: " + customAnnotation.getContents());
    }
}
```

## Extracting Annotations by Page

```java
// Extract annotations from a specific page (page number 2)
Page page = pdfDocument.getPages().get_Item(2);
for (Annotation annotation : page.getAnnotations()) {
    // Process annotations on this page
}
```

## Handling Different Annotation Types

Aspose.PDF for Java supports various annotation types such as text annotations, highlight annotations, custom stamps, and more. You can adapt the extraction code to suit your specific needs.
