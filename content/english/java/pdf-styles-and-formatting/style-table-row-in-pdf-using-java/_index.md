## Adding a Table to the PDF

To style table rows, we first need to add a table to our PDF document. Let's see how to do that:

```java
// Create a table
Table table = new Table();
pdfDocument.getPages().get_Item(1).getParagraphs().add(table);
```

## Styling Table Rows

Styling table rows in a PDF can include changing the background color, text color, font, and more. Aspose.PDF for Java provides various options for customizing row styles.

## Implementing Row Styling

Let's go through a step-by-step guide to styling table rows using Aspose.PDF for Java. We'll use Java code examples for each step.

### 1. Adding Rows to the Table

First, we need to add rows to our table. Here's how you can add a row:

```java
Row row = table.getRows().add();
```

### 2. Setting Row Background Color

To set the background color of a row, use the following code:

```java
row.getDefaultCellTextState().setBackgroundColor(Color.getLightGray());
```

### 3. Changing Text Color

You can change the text color of the row like this:

```java
row.getDefaultCellTextState().setForegroundColor(Color.getDarkBlue());
```

### 4. Applying Font Styles

To apply font styles, use the following code:

```java
TextState textState = row.getDefaultCellTextState();
textState.setFont(FontRepository.findFont("Helvetica-Bold"));
textState.setFontSize(12);
```

### 5. Adding Content to Cells

You can add content to the cells of the row as needed.

```java
Cell cell = row.getCells().add();
TextFragment text = new TextFragment("This is cell content.");
cell.getParagraphs().add(text);
```

Repeat these steps for each row you want to style in your table.

## Testing and Preview

After implementing the desired row styles, it's essential to test and preview your PDF document to ensure that the styling meets your requirements.
