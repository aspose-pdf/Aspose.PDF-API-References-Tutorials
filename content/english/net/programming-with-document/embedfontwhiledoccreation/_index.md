## Introduction

Creating PDF documents that look professional and polished is essential in today’s digital world. One of the key aspects of achieving that polished look is ensuring that the fonts used in your PDF are embedded correctly. This not only preserves the appearance of your document across different devices but also enhances readability. In this tutorial, we’ll dive into how to embed fonts while creating PDF documents using Aspose.PDF for .NET. 

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the code, let’s make sure you have everything you need to get started:

1. Aspose.PDF for .NET: You’ll need to have the Aspose.PDF library installed. You can download it from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/net/).
2. Visual Studio: A development environment where you can write and test your code.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will help you understand the code snippets better.

## Import Packages

To use Aspose.PDF in your project, you need to import the necessary namespaces. Here’s how you can do that:

```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf;
using Aspose.Pdf.Text;
```

These namespaces will give you access to the classes and methods required for creating and manipulating PDF documents.

Now that we have our prerequisites sorted out, let’s break down the process of embedding fonts into a PDF document into manageable steps.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Document Directory

First things first, you need to define the path where your PDF document will be saved. This is crucial because it tells your application where to store the output file.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path on your system where you want to save the PDF.

## Step 2: Instantiate the Pdf Document

Next, you’ll create an instance of the `Document` class. This class represents your PDF document.

```csharp
// Instantiate Pdf object by calling its empty constructor
Aspose.Pdf.Document doc = new Aspose.Pdf.Document();
```

By calling the empty constructor, you’re creating a new, blank PDF document ready for content.

## Step 3: Create a Page in the PDF Document

Now, let’s add a page to your PDF document. Every PDF needs at least one page, so this step is essential.

```csharp
// Create a section in the Pdf object
Aspose.Pdf.Page page = doc.Pages.Add();
```

This line of code adds a new page to your document, allowing you to start adding content.

## Step 4: Create a Text Fragment

To add text to your PDF, you’ll need to create a `TextFragment`. This object will hold the text you want to display.

```csharp
Aspose.Pdf.Text.TextFragment fragment = new Aspose.Pdf.Text.TextFragment("");
```

Here, we’re initializing a new `TextFragment`. You can think of it as a container for your text.

## Step 5: Add Text Segments

Now, let’s create a text segment that contains the actual text you want to display. This is where you can customize your text.

```csharp
Aspose.Pdf.Text.TextSegment segment = new Aspose.Pdf.Text.TextSegment("This is a sample text using Custom font.");
```

Feel free to change the text to whatever you want. This is your content!

## Step 6: Define Text State and Embed Font

To ensure that your font is embedded in the PDF, you need to set the font properties in the `TextState` object.

```csharp
Aspose.Pdf.Text.TextState ts = new Aspose.Pdf.Text.TextState();
ts.Font = FontRepository.FindFont("Arial");
ts.Font.IsEmbedded = true;
segment.TextState = ts;
```

In this code, we’re specifying that we want to use the Arial font and that it should be embedded in the PDF. This is a crucial step to ensure that your document looks the same on all devices.

## Step 7: Add the Segment to the Fragment

Now that you have your text segment ready, it’s time to add it to the text fragment.

```csharp
fragment.Segments.Add(segment);
```

This line adds the segment to the fragment, making it part of the text that will be displayed on the page.

## Step 8: Add the Fragment to the Page

Next, you’ll need to add the text fragment to the page you created earlier.

```csharp
page.Paragraphs.Add(fragment);
```

This step ensures that your text appears on the page of the PDF document.

## Step 9: Save the PDF Document

Finally, it’s time to save your PDF document. You’ll specify the path where you want to save it.

```csharp
dataDir = dataDir + "EmbedFontWhileDocCreation_out.pdf";
// Save PDF Document
doc.Save(dataDir);
```

This code concatenates the output file name to your document directory path and saves the PDF. 

## Conclusion

And there you have it! You’ve successfully created a PDF document with embedded fonts using Aspose.PDF for .NET. This process not only enhances the visual appeal of your documents but also ensures that they maintain their formatting across different platforms.
