## Introduction

Aspose.PDF for Java is a comprehensive Java library that allows developers to create, manipulate, and work with PDF documents in a seamless manner. In this step-by-step guide, we will explore how to fill form fields in a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for Java.

## Understanding Aspose.PDF for Java

Before we dive into the code, let's have a brief overview of Aspose.PDF for Java.

Aspose.PDF for Java provides a wide range of features for working with PDFs, including:

- Creating PDF documents from scratch.
- Modifying existing PDFs.
- Extracting data from PDFs.
- Adding form fields to PDFs.
- Filling form fields in PDFs.
- And much more.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- A code editor such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
- Aspose.PDF for Java library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/java/).

## Setting up the Environment

To get started, create a new Java project in your preferred IDE and add the Aspose.PDF for Java library to your project.

Now, let's proceed with the step-by-step guide on how to fill form fields in a PDF document using Java and Aspose.PDF.

## Creating a PDF Form

First, you need to have a PDF document with form fields. If you don't have one, you can create a simple PDF form using Aspose.PDF. Here's an example of how to create a basic PDF form:

```java
// Import the necessary classes
import com.aspose.pdf.*;

// Create a new PDF document
Document pdfDocument = new Document();
Page page = pdfDocument.getPages().add();

// Add a text field to the page
TextField textField = new TextField(page, new Rectangle(100, 100, 200, 30));
textField.setPartialName("text_field");
textField.setValue("Your Name");
page.getAnnotations().add(textField);

// Save the PDF document
pdfDocument.save("sample_form.pdf");
```

In this code snippet, we create a PDF document with a text field.

## Filling Form Fields

Now that we have a PDF form with fields, let's proceed to fill those fields programmatically. Here's how you can do it:

```java
// Open the existing PDF document
Document pdfDocument = new Document("sample_form.pdf");

// Access the form field by its name
com.aspose.pdf.forms.TextBoxField textBoxField = (com.aspose.pdf.forms.TextBoxField) pdfDocument.getForm().get("text_field");

// Set the value for the form field
textBoxField.setValue("John Doe");

// Save the modified PDF
pdfDocument.save("filled_form.pdf");
```

In this code snippet, we open the existing PDF document, access the form field by its name, and set a new value for it. Finally, we save the modified PDF with the filled form field.

## Saving the Modified PDF

Now that we've filled the form field, the modified PDF can be saved as a new file or overwrite the existing one, depending on your requirements.

```java
// Save the modified PDF (optional)
pdfDocument.save("filled_form.pdf");
```
