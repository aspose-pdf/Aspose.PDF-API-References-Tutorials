## Introduction

In the world of document processing, PDF files are ubiquitous, and they often contain images. Determining whether an image inside a PDF document is colored or black and white can be a crucial task, especially in scenarios where image processing or analysis is required. In this article, we will explore how to identify the color mode of images within a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for Java.

## Understanding Aspose.PDF for Java

Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful library that allows developers to work with PDF documents in Java applications. It provides a wide range of features for creating, manipulating, and extracting content from PDF files.

## Identifying Image Color in PDF

To determine if an image inside a PDF is colored or black and white, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's get started.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Aspose.PDF for Java library (You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/java/)

## Loading a PDF Document

To start, we'll load a PDF document that contains the images we want to analyze. You can use Aspose.PDF for Java to load the PDF file with a single line of code.

```java
// Load the PDF document
Document pdfDocument = new Document("sample.pdf");
```

## Extracting Images from the PDF

Next, we need to extract the images from the PDF. Aspose.PDF for Java provides a straightforward way to do this.

```java
// Get the page that contains the image (e.g., page 1)
Page page = pdfDocument.getPages().get_Item(1);

// Get the images from the page
XImageCollection images = page.getResources().getImages();
```

## Determining Image Color

Now that we have the images, we can determine their color. For each image, we can check whether it's colored or black and white by analyzing its properties.

```java
for (XImage image : images) {
    // Check if the image is colored
    boolean isColored = image.isColored();
    
    if (isColored) {
        System.out.println("Image is colored.");
    } else {
        System.out.println("Image is black and white.");
    }
}
```

## Displaying the Results

Finally, we can display the results to the user or save them for further processing. This simple code snippet allows us to identify the color status of images within a PDF document effortlessly.

## Sample Code

Here's a complete sample code snippet that demonstrates how to identify if an image inside a PDF is colored or black and white using Aspose.PDF for Java:

```java
// Load the PDF document
Document pdfDocument = new Document("sample.pdf");

// Get the page that contains the image (e.g., page 1)
Page page = pdfDocument.getPages().get_Item(1);

// Get the images from the page
XImageCollection images = page.getResources().getImages();

// Determine image color
for (XImage image : images) {
    // Check if the image is colored
    boolean isColored = image.isColored();
    
    if (isColored) {
        System.out.println("Image is colored.");
    } else {
        System.out.println("Image is black and white.");
    }
}
```
