# Introduction
In this tutorial, we will explore how to add HTML strings to PDF documents using the Aspose.PDF for Java library. Aspose.PDF is a powerful tool for working with PDF files in Java applications. Adding HTML content to a PDF can be useful in scenarios where you want to include dynamic or formatted text in your PDF document. We'll walk you through the process with code examples, so let's get started.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Java development environment set up.
- Aspose.PDF for Java library installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/java/).

## Step 1: Create a New PDF Document
To get started, you need to create a new PDF document using Aspose.PDF. Here's how you can do it in Java:

```java
// Create a new PDF document
Document pdfDocument = new Document();
```

## Step 2: Add a Page to the Document
Next, you'll need to add a page to the PDF document where you want to insert the HTML content:

```java
// Add a page to the document
Page page = pdfDocument.getPages().add();
```

## Step 3: Define the HTML String
Now, you can define the HTML string that you want to add to the PDF. For example:

```java
String htmlContent = "<h1>Hello, Aspose.PDF!</h1><p>This is an example of adding HTML content to a PDF document.</p>";
```

## Step 4: Add HTML String to the Page
To add the HTML string to the page, you can use the `HtmlFragment` class:

```java
// Create an HtmlFragment with the HTML content
HtmlFragment htmlFragment = new HtmlFragment(htmlContent);

// Add the HtmlFragment to the page
page.getParagraphs().add(htmlFragment);
```

## Step 5: Save the PDF Document
Finally, you can save the PDF document to a file:

```java
// Save the PDF document to a file
pdfDocument.save("output.pdf");
```

That's it! You've successfully added an HTML string to a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for Java.
