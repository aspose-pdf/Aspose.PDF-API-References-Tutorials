In this tutorial, we will provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to load a license from a file using Aspose.PDF for .NET. Aspose.PDF is a powerful library that allows you to create, manipulate and convert PDF documents programmatically. By uploading a license, you can unlock additional features offered by Aspose.PDF.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Visual Studio installed with .NET framework.
2. The Aspose.PDF library for .NET.

## Step 1: Project Setup

To get started, create a new project in Visual Studio and add a reference to the Aspose.PDF for .NET library. You can download the library from Aspose official website and install it on your machine.

## Step 2: Import the necessary namespaces

In your C# code file, import the namespaces required to access the classes and methods provided by Aspose.PDF:

```csharp
using System;
using Aspose.Pdf;
```

## Step 3: Defining the document directory

Before uploading the license, you must specify the path to the documents directory where your license file is located. For example :

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

Be sure to replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path to the documents directory on your machine.

## Step 4: License Object Initialization

After setting the document directory, you need to initialize the license object of Aspose.PDF. Use the following line of code to initialize the license object:

```csharp
Aspose.Pdf.License license = new Aspose.Pdf.License();
```

## Step 5: Loading the license from a file

Once the license object is initialized, you can load the license from a file. Use the following line of code to load the license:

```csharp
license.SetLicense("PATH_TO_LICENSE_FILE");
```

Be sure to replace `"PATH_TO_LICENSE_FILE"` with the actual path to the license file on your machine.

## Step 6: License Upload Confirmation

After loading the license, you can display a confirmation message to check if the license has been loaded successfully. Use the following line of code to display a message in the console:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("License loaded successfully.");
```
