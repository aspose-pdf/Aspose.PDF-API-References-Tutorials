## Introduction
In this step-by-step guide, we will learn how to add a table of contents to an existing PDF in Java using the Aspose.PDF for Java library. Table of contents is a helpful feature in PDF documents that allows readers to navigate through the document quickly.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Aspose.PDF for Java library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/java/).

## Adding Dependencies
To get started, create a new Java project and add the Aspose.PDF for Java library to your project's dependencies. You can do this by including the JAR file in your project's build path.

## Creating a New PDF Document
Let's start by creating a new PDF document that we will add a table of contents to. Here's a sample code to create a new PDF document:

```java
// Create a new PDF document
com.aspose.pdf.Document pdfDocument = new com.aspose.pdf.Document();
```

## Adding a Table of Contents
To add a table of contents to the PDF document, we need to create a TableOfContents object and specify its properties. Here's how you can do it:

```java
// Create a TableOfContents object
com.aspose.pdf.TableOfContents tableOfContents = new com.aspose.pdf.TableOfContents();
tableOfContents.setTitle("Table of Contents"); // Set the title of the table of contents
tableOfContents.setDisplayPageNumbers(true); // Display page numbers
```

## Adding Sections to the Document
Next, we'll add sections to the PDF document. These sections will represent the different chapters or sections of the document. Here's an example:

```java
// Create a section
com.aspose.pdf.Section section = pdfDocument.getSections().add();

// Add content to the section (e.g., text, images, etc.)
// You can add your document content here

// Add the section to the table of contents
tableOfContents.getSections().add(section);
```

## Generating Page Numbers
To generate page numbers for the table of contents, you can use the following code:

```java
// Generate page numbers for the table of contents
pdfDocument.getPages().accept(new PageNumberStamp());
```

## Styling the Table of Contents
You can customize the appearance of the table of contents by setting its properties, such as font size, color, and style. Here's an example:

```java
// Customize the appearance of the table of contents
TextState textState = tableOfContents.getTextState();
textState.setFont(FontRepository.findFont("Arial"));
textState.setFontSize(12);
textState.setForegroundColor(Color.getBlue());
```

## Saving the PDF Document
Finally, save the modified PDF document with the table of contents included:

```java
// Save the PDF document with the table of contents
pdfDocument.save("output.pdf");
```
