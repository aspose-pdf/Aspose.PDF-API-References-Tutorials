## Introduction to Convert Dynamic XFA Form to Standard AcroForm in PDF

In the world of PDF manipulation and generation, the need to convert Dynamic XFA (XML Forms Architecture) forms to Standard AcroForms is a common requirement. XFA forms, known for their dynamic and interactive features, have their merits.
