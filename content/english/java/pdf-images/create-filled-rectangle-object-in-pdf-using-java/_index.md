## Introduction to Create Filled Rectangle Object in PDF using Java

In this tutorial, we will explore how to create a filled rectangle object in a PDF document using Java with the help of Aspose.PDF for Java. Filled rectangles are commonly used in PDFs for various purposes, such as highlighting important information or creating visual separations.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ
- Aspose.PDF for Java library downloaded and configured

## Setting Up Aspose.PDF for Java

To get started, you need to download Aspose.PDF for Java from the website. Follow these steps:

1. Access the Aspose.PDF for Java documentation at [here](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/).

2. Download the library and follow the installation instructions provided.

3. Import the Aspose.PDF library into your Java project.

Now that we have set up Aspose.PDF for Java, let's dive into creating a filled rectangle in a PDF document.

## Creating a New PDF Document

In this section, we will create a new PDF document using Aspose.PDF for Java. First, import the necessary classes:

```java
import com.aspose.pdf.Document;
import com.aspose.pdf.Page;
import com.aspose.pdf.Rectangle;
```

Next, create a new document and a page:

```java
Document pdfDocument = new Document();
Page page = pdfDocument.getPages().add();
```

## Adding a Filled Rectangle

To add a filled rectangle, you'll need to define its coordinates, dimensions, and color. Here's an example of how to create a filled rectangle:

```java
Rectangle filledRectangle = new Rectangle(page, 100, 100, 200, 50);
filledRectangle.setBackgroundColor(com.aspose.pdf.Color.getRed());
page.getParagraphs().add(filledRectangle);
```

In this code:
- We create a new `Rectangle` object, specifying its position (x=100, y=100), width (200), and height (50).
- We set the background color of the rectangle to red.
- Finally, we add the rectangle to the page.

## Customizing the Rectangle

You can customize the rectangle further by changing its color, border, or other properties. Explore the Aspose.PDF for Java documentation for more options.

## Saving the PDF

After creating the PDF document with the filled rectangle, save it to a file:

```java
pdfDocument.save("FilledRectangle.pdf");
```

## Running the Code

Compile and run your Java code. You should now have a PDF file named "FilledRectangle.pdf" with a filled rectangle.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've learned how to create a filled rectangle object in a PDF document using Java and Aspose.PDF for Java. This can be useful for highlighting important information or adding visual elements to your PDFs. Aspose.PDF for Java provides a powerful and flexible way to work with PDFs in Java applications.
