## Introduction to Aspose.PDF for Java

Aspose.PDF for Java is a robust library that allows developers to work with PDF documents programmatically. It provides a wide range of features for PDF manipulation, including text formatting, page manipulation, and, of course, applying numbering styles to headings.

## Setting up the Development Environment

Before we dive into the code, make sure you have the necessary tools set up in your development environment:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.)
- Aspose.PDF for Java library

## Creating a PDF Document

Let's start by creating a new PDF document using Aspose.PDF for Java. Here's some sample code to get you started:

```java
// Create a new PDF document
com.aspose.pdf.Document pdfDocument = new com.aspose.pdf.Document();
```

## Adding Headings to the PDF

Now, we'll add some headings to our PDF document. These headings will serve as the sections in our document. Here's an example of adding a heading:

```java
// Create a heading
com.aspose.pdf.Heading heading = new com.aspose.pdf.Heading(pdfDocument.getPages().get_Item(1));
heading.setMargin(new com.aspose.pdf.MarginInfo(0, 0, 0, 10));
heading.getTextState().setFont(new com.aspose.pdf.FontRepository().findFont("Arial"));
heading.getTextState().setFontSize(16);
heading.getTextState().setBold(true);
heading.getTextState().setForegroundColor(com.aspose.pdf.Color.getBlack());
heading.getTextState().setBackgroundColor(com.aspose.pdf.Color.getLightGray());

// Set the heading text
TextFragment titleFragment = new TextFragment("Applying Numbering Style");
heading.getFragments().add(titleFragment);
pdfDocument.getPages().get_Item(1).getParagraphs().add(heading);
```

## Applying Numbering Style

Now comes the exciting partâ€”applying numbering styles to our headings. Aspose.PDF for Java provides a straightforward way to achieve this. Here's an example of applying numbering:

```java
// Create a numbering style
com.aspose.pdf.NumberingStyle numberingStyle = new com.aspose.pdf.NumberingStyle();
numberingStyle.setFormat("(1)");
numberingStyle.setFirstIndex(1);

// Apply the numbering style to the heading
heading.setNumberingStyle(numberingStyle);
```

## Customizing Numbering Formats

You can customize the numbering format to suit your needs. Aspose.PDF for Java allows you to control various aspects of numbering, including prefix, suffix, and format. Here's an example of customizing numbering:

```java
// Customize the numbering style
numberingStyle.setPrefix("Section ");
numberingStyle.setSuffix(":");
numberingStyle.setStartNumber(5);
```

## Saving and Viewing the PDF

Once you've added headings with numbering styles, it's time to save the PDF document and view the result:

```java
// Save the PDF document
pdfDocument.save("NumberedDocument.pdf");

// Open the PDF document for viewing
java.awt.Desktop.getDesktop().open(new java.io.File("NumberedDocument.pdf"));
```

## Conclusion

In this step-by-step guide, we've explored how to apply numbering styles to headings in PDF documents using Aspose.PDF for Java. This powerful library makes it easy to create professional-looking documents with customized numbering formats.
