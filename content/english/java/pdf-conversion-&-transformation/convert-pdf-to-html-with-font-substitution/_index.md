## Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Open your IDE.
2. Create a new Java project.
3. Add the Aspose.PDF for Java library to your project's dependencies.

## Importing Aspose.PDF for Java

```java
import com.aspose.pdf.Document;
import com.aspose.pdf.HtmlSaveOptions;
```

## Loading a PDF Document

```java
// Load the PDF document
Document pdfDocument = new Document("input.pdf");
```

## Configuring Font Substitution

```java
// Create an instance of HtmlSaveOptions
HtmlSaveOptions saveOptions = new HtmlSaveOptions();

// Enable font substitution
saveOptions.setUseSubstitutions(true);

// Set custom font mappings if needed
saveOptions.setFontSavingMode(HtmlSaveOptions.FontSavingModes.SAVE_IN_ALL_FORMATS);
```

## Converting PDF to HTML with Font Substitution

```java
// Convert PDF to HTML with font substitution
pdfDocument.save("output.html", saveOptions);
```

## Handling Exceptions

```java
try {
    // Perform the conversion
    pdfDocument.save("output.html", saveOptions);
} catch (Exception ex) {
    System.out.println("An error occurred: " + ex.getMessage());
}
```

## Customizing the Conversion

You can further customize the HTML output by adjusting the `HtmlSaveOptions` parameters. This allows you to control various aspects of the conversion, such as image compression and text formatting.
