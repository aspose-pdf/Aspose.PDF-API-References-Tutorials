## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

// Open Markdown document
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "sample.md", new MdLoadOptions());

Be sure to replace `"YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY"` with the actual directory where your Markdown file is located.

## Step 2: Markdown to PDF conversion
