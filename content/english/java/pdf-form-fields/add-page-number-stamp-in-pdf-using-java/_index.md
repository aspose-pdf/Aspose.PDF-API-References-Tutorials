## Introduction to Add Page Number Stamp in PDF using Java

PDF documents are widely used for sharing and presenting information, but sometimes you may need to enhance them by adding page numbers. Whether you're working on reports, manuals, or academic papers, page numbers help readers navigate your content efficiently. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of adding page number stamps to PDF files using Java. We'll be using Aspose.PDF for Java, a powerful library that simplifies PDF manipulation.

## Setting Up Aspose.PDF for Java

Before we dive into coding, you'll need to set up Aspose.PDF for Java. Follow these steps:

1. Download Aspose.PDF for Java: Access the library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/java/) and download the appropriate version for your project.

2. Create a Java Project: If you don't already have a Java project, set up a new one using your preferred IDE.

## Adding Dependencies

Once you have Aspose.PDF for Java, add it as a dependency to your project. If you're using Maven, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspose-pdf</artifactId>
    <version>21.11</version> <!-- Replace with the latest version -->
</dependency>
```

If you prefer Gradle, include this in your `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
implementation group: 'com.aspose', name: 'aspose-pdf', version: '21.11' // Replace with the latest version
```

## Coding the Page Number Stamp

Now, let's dive into the code. We'll create a simple Java program to add page number stamps to a PDF document.

```java
import com.aspose.pdf.*;

public class AddPageNumberStamp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Load the PDF document
        Document pdfDocument = new Document("input.pdf");

        // Create a page number stamp
        PageNumberStamp pageNumberStamp = new PageNumberStamp();
        pageNumberStamp.setBackground(true);
        pageNumberStamp.setForeground(false);
        pageNumberStamp.setStartingNumber(1);
        pageNumberStamp.setFormat("Page #");

        // Add the stamp to all pages
        for (int page = 1; page <= pdfDocument.getPages().size(); page++) {
            pdfDocument.getPages().get_Item(page).addStamp(pageNumberStamp);
        }

        // Save the modified PDF
        pdfDocument.save("output.pdf");
    }
}
```

In this code, we load a PDF document, create a page number stamp, customize its appearance and format, and then apply it to all pages of the document.

## Applying the Page Number Stamp

To apply the page number stamp, follow these steps:

1. Load the PDF document using `Document pdfDocument = new Document("input.pdf");`, where `"input.pdf"` is the path to your PDF file.

2. Create a `PageNumberStamp` object and customize it according to your preferences.

3. Add the stamp to each page in the PDF using a loop.

4. Save the modified PDF using `pdfDocument.save("output.pdf");`. You can replace `"output.pdf"` with the desired file name.

## Testing the Result

Now that you've added the page number stamp to your PDF, it's time to test the result. Run your Java program, and you'll see the page numbers applied to each page of the PDF document.
