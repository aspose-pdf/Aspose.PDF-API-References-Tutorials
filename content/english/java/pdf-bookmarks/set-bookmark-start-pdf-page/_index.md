## What is Aspose.PDF for Java?

Aspose.PDF for Java is a Java library that allows developers to create, manipulate, and render PDF documents in their Java applications. It provides a wide range of features for working with PDF files, including creating, editing, and converting PDFs.

## Setting Up Your Java Environment

Before we start working with Aspose.PDF for Java, you need to set up your Java development environment. Make sure you have Java JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your system.

## Adding Aspose.PDF to Your Project

To use Aspose.PDF for Java in your project, you need to add the Aspose.PDF library to your project's dependencies. You can do this by downloading the Aspose.PDF JAR file from the website and including it in your project.

## Creating a PDF Document

```

## Adding Content to the PDF

```java
// Create a bookmark to the start of the page
OutlineItemCollection outlines = pdfDocument.getOutlines();
OutlineItemCollection outlineItem = new OutlineItemCollection(outlines);
outlineItem.setTitle("Start of Page");
outlineItem.setDestination(new XYZExplicitDestination(1, 0, 0, 0));
outlines.add(outlineItem);
```

pdfDocument.save("sample.pdf");
```
