## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of getting the dimensions of an SVG file using Aspose.PDF for .NET. SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based image format used to represent vector graphics. Using the steps below, you will be able to get the dimensions of an SVG file and save them as a PDF.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge of the C# programming language.
- Aspose.PDF library for .NET installed on your system.
- A development environment such as Visual Studio.

## Step 1: Loading SVG file
In this step, we will load the SVG file using Aspose.PDF for .NET. Follow the code below:

```csharp
// Path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";

var loadopt = new SvgLoadOptions();
loadopt.AdjustPageSize = true;
var svgDoc = new Document(dataDir + "GetSVGDimensions.svg", loadopt);
```

Be sure to replace `"YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY"` with the actual directory where your SVG file is located.

## Step 2: Page size adjustment
Now that we've loaded the SVG file, we can adjust the page size to accommodate the SVG content. Use the following code:

```csharp
svgDoc.Pages[1].PageInfo.Margin.Top = 0;
svgDoc.Pages[1].PageInfo.Margin.Left = 0;
svgDoc.Pages[1].PageInfo.Margin.Bottom = 0;
svgDoc.Pages[1].PageInfo.Margin.Right = 0;
```

The code above sets the page margins to zero, allowing the page size to adjust based on the SVG content.

## Step 3: Saving the resulting PDF
After adjusting the page size, we can now save the resulting PDF document. Here is the last step:

```csharp
svgDoc.Save(dataDir + "GetSVGDimensions_out.pdf");
```

Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY"` with the desired directory where you want to save the output PDF file.
  
### Example source code for Get SVG Dimensions using Aspose.PDF for .NET

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

var loadopt = new SvgLoadOptions();
loadopt.AdjustPageSize = true;
var svgDoc = new Document(dataDir + "GetSVGDimensions.svg", loadopt);
svgDoc.Pages[1].PageInfo.Margin.Top = 0;
svgDoc.Pages[1].PageInfo.Margin.Left = 0;
svgDoc.Pages[1].PageInfo.Margin.Bottom = 0;
svgDoc.Pages[1].PageInfo.Margin.Right = 0;
svgDoc.Save(dataDir + "GetSVGDimensions_out.pdf");
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've covered the step-by-step process of getting the dimensions of an SVG file using Aspose.PDF for .NET. By following the instructions outlined above, you should now be able to get the dimensions of an SVG file and save them to the PDF Format. This feature can be useful when you need to measure the dimensions of a vector graphic.

### FAQ's

#### Q: What is SVG?

A: SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based image format used to represent vector graphics. Unlike raster images, SVG files are resolution-independent and can be scaled without losing quality. SVG is widely used for displaying graphics on the web and can be edited and manipulated with ease.

#### Q: Why use Aspose.PDF for .NET for SVG to PDF conversion?

A: Aspose.PDF for .NET provides a reliable and efficient way to handle SVG files and convert them to PDF format. It offers various options and settings to customize the conversion process, such as adjusting page size, margins, and other properties to ensure accurate representation in the PDF.

#### Q: Can I convert SVG files with complex graphics and text?

A: Yes, Aspose.PDF for .NET can handle SVG files with complex graphics, text, and vector elements. It accurately preserves the details and quality of the SVG content during the conversion process, resulting in high-quality PDF documents.

#### Q: Is it possible to extract text from SVG files with Aspose.PDF for .NET?

A: Yes, Aspose.PDF for .NET allows you to extract text from SVG files. You can use the library's text extraction features to extract text elements from SVG and save them separately for further processing.
