# Extracting Tagged PDF Content using Java and Aspose.PDF for Java

Tagged PDFs are structured in a way that makes them accessible for individuals with disabilities and also aids in automated content extraction. In this step-by-step guide, we will explore how to extract content from tagged PDFs using Java and the Aspose.PDF for Java library. We will provide source code examples to make the process clear and accessible.

## Introduction

Tagged PDFs contain structural information that helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the document's content. Extracting content from tagged PDFs is crucial for various applications, such as data analysis, content repurposing, and accessibility compliance.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, ensure you have the following:

1. Java Development Environment: Make sure you have Java installed on your system.

2. Aspose.PDF for Java Library: You can download the library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/java/). Include it in your Java project.

## Step 1: Create a Java Project

Begin by creating a new Java project in your preferred integrated development environment (IDE). Add the Aspose.PDF for Java library to your project's dependencies.

## Step 2: Initialize Aspose.PDF

In your Java project, initialize Aspose.PDF by adding the following code to your main class:

```java
import com.aspose.pdf.Document;

public class TaggedPDFExtractor {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize Aspose.PDF
        Document pdfDocument = new Document("path_to_tagged_pdf.pdf");
    }
}
```

Replace `"path_to_tagged_pdf.pdf"` with the actual path to your tagged PDF file.

## Step 3: Extract Tagged Content

Now, let's extract the tagged content from the PDF. Add the following code to your main class:

```java
import com.aspose.pdf.TextAbsorber;
import com.aspose.pdf.TextExtractionOptions;

public class TaggedPDFExtractor {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize Aspose.PDF
        Document pdfDocument = new Document("path_to_tagged_pdf.pdf");

        // Create TextAbsorber object
        TextAbsorber textAbsorber = new TextAbsorber();

        // Set text extraction options
        TextExtractionOptions options = new TextExtractionOptions(TextExtractionOptions.TextFormattingMode.Pure);
        textAbsorber.setTextExtractionOptions(options);

        // Accept the absorber for all the pages
        for (int page = 1; page <= pdfDocument.getPages().size(); page++) {
            pdfDocument.getPages().get_Item(page).accept(textAbsorber);
        }

        // Extract and print the tagged text
        String extractedText = textAbsorber.getText();
        System.out.println(extractedText);
    }
}
```

This code initializes Aspose.PDF, sets up a TextAbsorber to extract tagged text, and then loops through all the pages to extract and print the content.

## Step 4: Compile and Run

Compile your Java project and run it. The extracted tagged content from the PDF will be displayed in the console.

## Conclusion

Extracting content from tagged PDFs using Java and Aspose.PDF for Java is essential for various applications, including accessibility compliance and data analysis. By following this step-by-step guide and utilizing the provided source code, you can easily incorporate tagged PDF content extraction into your Java applications.
