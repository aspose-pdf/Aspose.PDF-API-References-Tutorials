## Introduction to Adding PDF Page Stamp in the PDF File using Java

PDFs are a widely used format for document sharing and archiving. Often, there's a need to add additional information or branding to existing PDF documents. In this tutorial, we will explore how to add a PDF page stamp using Java with the help of Aspose.PDF for Java.

## Understanding PDF Page Stamps

A PDF page stamp is an image or text that is added to a PDF page as an overlay. This can be useful for adding watermarks, logos, page numbers, or any other information that should appear on every page of a PDF document.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA
- Aspose.PDF for Java library (You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/java/).

## Setting Up the Environment

Let's start by setting up our development environment. Ensure you have your JDK and IDE installed and configured.

## Adding Dependencies

Create a new Java project in your IDE and add the Aspose.PDF for Java library to your project's dependencies. You can do this by adding the JAR file to your project's build path.

## Creating a Java Project

Create a new Java project in your IDE and name it as per your preference.

## Importing Aspose.PDF Library

Import the Aspose.PDF library at the beginning of your Java class:

```java
import com.aspose.pdf.*;
```

## Defining the PDF Document

To work with a PDF document, you need to define it first. Let's create a PDF document object:

```java
Document pdfDocument = new Document("input.pdf");
```

## Creating a Page Stamp

Now, let's create a page stamp, which can be either an image or text. For this example, we will create a text stamp:

```java
TextStamp textStamp = new TextStamp("Sample Stamp Text");
```

## Configuring the Page Stamp

You can configure various properties of the page stamp, such as font, color, and position. Here's an example of how to configure the text stamp:

```java
textStamp.getTextState().setFont(FontRepository.findFont("Arial"));
textStamp.getTextState().setFontSize(12);
textStamp.getTextState().setFontStyle(FontStyles.Bold);
textStamp.setTextColor(Color.RED);
textStamp.setVerticalAlignment(VerticalAlignment.Top);
textStamp.setHorizontalAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Center);
```

## Applying the Page Stamp

Now that we have configured our page stamp, let's apply it to the PDF pages:

```java
for (int pageNumber = 1; pageNumber <= pdfDocument.getPages().size(); pageNumber++) {
    pdfDocument.getPages().get_Item(pageNumber).addStamp(textStamp);
}
```

## Saving the Modified PDF

Once the page stamp is applied to all pages, save the modified PDF:

```java
pdfDocument.save("output.pdf");
```

## Running the Java Application

Now you can run your Java application. It will add the page stamp to the specified PDF document.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to add a PDF page stamp to a PDF file using Java and the Aspose.PDF for Java library. We explored the basic steps, from setting up the environment to configuring and applying the stamp. You can now enhance your PDF documents by adding watermarks, logos, or other information with ease. Happy coding!
