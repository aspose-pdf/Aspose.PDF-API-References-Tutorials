Retrieving bookmark in PDF file can be useful for analyzing the document's structure and navigational information. With Aspose.PDF for .NET, you can easily get the bookmarks by following the following source code:

## Step 1: Import required libraries

Before you begin, you need to import the necessary libraries for your C# project. Here is the necessary import directive:

```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf;
```

## Step 2: Set path to documents folder

In this step, you need to specify the path to the folder containing the PDF file you want to extract the bookmarks from. Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` in the following code with the actual path to your documents folder:

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 3: Open the PDF document

Now we are going to open the PDF document from which we want to extract the bookmarks using the following code:

```csharp
Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "GetBookmarks.pdf");
```

## Step 4: Browse Bookmarks

In this step, we will iterate over all the bookmarks in the document using a `foreach` loop. For each bookmark, we will display the information such as title, italic style, bold style and color. Here is the corresponding code:

```csharp
foreach(OutlineItemCollection outlineItem in pdfDocument.Outlines)
{
     Console.WriteLine(outlineItem.Title);
     Console.WriteLine(outlineItem.Italic);
     Console.WriteLine(outlineItem.Bold);
     Console.WriteLine(outlineItem.Color);
}
```
