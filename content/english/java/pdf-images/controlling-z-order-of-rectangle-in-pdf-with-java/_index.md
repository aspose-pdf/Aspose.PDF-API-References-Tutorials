## Introduction

In the world of PDF manipulation, managing the Z-order of elements is crucial when you want to control the visibility and positioning of objects within your PDF document. This article will delve into the art of controlling the Z-order of rectangles in a PDF using Aspose.PDF for Java, a powerful Java API for working with PDF files.

## Understanding Z-Order in PDFs

Before we dive into the technical details, let's grasp the concept of Z-order in PDFs. Z-order refers to the depth or layering of graphical objects within a PDF page. Objects with a higher Z-order value are displayed in front of objects with lower values. This concept is similar to layers in image editing software.

## Controlling Z-Order in PDFs

Controlling the Z-order of elements in a PDF is essential for various use cases. For example, you might want to place a watermark behind the main content, ensure that certain annotations are always visible, or arrange graphical elements in a specific order for better presentation.

## Setting the Z-Order Using Aspose.PDF for Java

To achieve precise control over the Z-order of rectangles in a PDF using Aspose.PDF for Java, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Java development environment set up.
- Aspose.PDF for Java library installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/java/).

## Step-by-Step Guide

Let's dive into the practical steps to control the Z-order of rectangles in a PDF using Aspose.PDF for Java:

### Step 1: Create a New Java Project

Begin by creating a new Java project in your favorite IDE.

### Step 2: Add Aspose.PDF for Java Library

Add the Aspose.PDF for Java library to your project's dependencies. You can do this by including the JAR file you downloaded earlier.

### Step 3: Initialize a PDF Document

```java
// Initialize a PDF document
com.aspose.pdf.Document pdfDocument = new com.aspose.pdf.Document();
```

### Step 4: Create Rectangles

```java
// Create rectangles with different Z-order values
com.aspose.pdf.Page page = pdfDocument.getPages().get_Item(1);
com.aspose.pdf.Rectangle rect1 = new com.aspose.pdf.Rectangle(100, 100, 200, 200);
com.aspose.pdf.Rectangle rect2 = new com.aspose.pdf.Rectangle(150, 150, 250, 250);

// Set Z-order for rectangles
rect1.setZIndex(1);
rect2.setZIndex(2);

// Add rectangles to the page
page.getParagraphs().add(rect1);
page.getParagraphs().add(rect2);
```

### Step 5: Save the PDF Document

```java
// Save the PDF document
pdfDocument.save("output.pdf");
```

### Step 6: Run the Code

Execute your Java code, and it will generate a PDF with rectangles arranged based on their Z-order.

## Conclusion

In this article, we've explored the importance of controlling the Z-order of rectangles in PDF documents and provided a step-by-step guide using Aspose.PDF for Java. Now, you can confidently manage the visibility and positioning of graphical elements in your PDFs.
