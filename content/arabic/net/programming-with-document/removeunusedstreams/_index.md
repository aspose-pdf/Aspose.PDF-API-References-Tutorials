In this example, we will discuss how to remove unused streams in PDF files using Aspose.PDF for .NET. We will provide a step-by-step guide on how to do this, including the full source code with explanations.

## Step 1: The path to the documents directory

The first line of the code sets the path to the directory where your PDF document is located. Make sure to replace "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY" with the actual directory path.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 2: Open the document

The next line of code opens the PDF document using the Aspose.PDF for .NET library.

```csharp
Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "OptimizeDocument.pdf");
```

## Step 3: Set RemoveUnusedStreams option

The next step is to set the RemoveUnusedStreams option to true. This will remove any unused streams from the PDF document.

```csharp
var optimizeOptions = new Pdf.Optimization.OptimizationOptions
{
	RemoveUnusedStreams = true
};
```

## Step 4: Optimize PDF document using OptimizationOptions

Now that we have set the optimization options, we can optimize the PDF document using the following line of code.

```csharp
pdfDocument.OptimizeResources(optimizeOptions);
```

## Step 5: Save updated document

Finally, we can save the updated document using the Save method of the Document class.

```csharp
dataDir = dataDir + "OptimizeDocument_out.pdf";
pdfDocument.Save(dataDir);
```

### Example source code for Remove Unused Streams using Aspose.PDF for .NET

Below is the example source code for removing unused streams using Aspose.PDF for .NET.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
// Open document
Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "OptimizeDocument.pdf");
// Set RemoveUsedStreams option 
var optimizeOptions = new Pdf.Optimization.OptimizationOptions
{
	RemoveUnusedStreams = true
};
// Optimize PDF document using OptimizationOptions
pdfDocument.OptimizeResources(optimizeOptions);
dataDir = dataDir + "OptimizeDocument_out.pdf";
// Save updated document
pdfDocument.Save(dataDir);
```

## Conclusion

Optimizing PDF documents by removing unused streams is essential for enhancing performance and reducing file size. Aspose.PDF for .NET simplifies this process by providing a convenient method to remove unused streams using the `OptimizationOptions`. The step-by-step guide and the provided C# source code make it easy for developers to implement this feature in their .NET applications. By following these instructions, developers can optimize their PDF files effectively and improve overall PDF processing in their .NET projects.

### FAQ's for remove unused streams in PDF file

#### Q: What are unused streams in a PDF document?

A: Unused streams in a PDF document are parts of the file that are not referenced or used in the document's content. These streams may include images, fonts, or other resources that are no longer needed but still exist in the PDF file.

#### Q: How does removing unused streams benefit PDF documents?

A: Removing unused streams from a PDF document reduces its file size, resulting in faster loading times and improved performance. It helps in optimizing the PDF file for better user experience and efficient storage.

#### Q: Can developers specify which streams to remove using Aspose.PDF for .NET?

A: Yes, developers can control the removal of unused streams by setting the `RemoveUnusedStreams` option in the `OptimizationOptions`. This gives them the flexibility to choose which streams to remove based on their specific needs.
