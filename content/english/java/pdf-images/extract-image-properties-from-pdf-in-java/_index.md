Aspose.PDF for Java is a powerful library that allows you to work with PDF documents in Java applications. In this step-by-step guide, we will explore how to extract image properties from a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for Java. We will provide you with source code examples to make the process easy to understand.

## 1. Introduction

PDF documents often contain images, and it can be useful to extract information about these images programmatically. Aspose.PDF for Java provides a convenient way to extract image properties such as dimensions, resolution, and format. Let's get started!

## 2. Setting Up Aspose.PDF for Java

Before we begin, you need to set up Aspose.PDF for Java in your project. You can download the library from the website [here](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/java/) and follow the installation instructions.

## 3. Loading a PDF Document

To work with a PDF document, you first need to load it using Aspose.PDF for Java. Here's how you can do it:

```java
// Load the PDF document
Document pdfDocument = new Document("example.pdf");
```

Replace `"example.pdf"` with the path to your PDF file.

## 4. Extracting Image Properties

Now that we have loaded the PDF document, let's extract image properties. Aspose.PDF for Java provides the `Page.getResources()` method to access the resources of a page, including images.

```java
// Access the first page of the document
Page page = pdfDocument.getPages().get_Item(1);

// Access the resources of the page
Resources resources = page.getResources();

// Get the images from the resources
Iterable<XImage> images = resources.getImages();
```

## 5. Accessing Image Information

With the images extracted, you can access various properties of each image, such as dimensions, resolution, and format. Here's an example of how to do it:

```java
// Iterate through the images
for (XImage image : images) {
    // Get the image width and height
    int width = image.getWidth();
    int height = image.getHeight();

    // Get the image resolution
    int resolution = image.getResolution();

    // Get the image format (e.g., JPEG, PNG)
    String format = image.getFileFormat().toString();

    // Print the image properties
    System.out.println("Image Width: " + width);
    System.out.println("Image Height: " + height);
    System.out.println("Image Resolution: " + resolution + " DPI");
    System.out.println("Image Format: " + format);
}
```

## 6. Modifying Image Properties

If you need to modify image properties, such as resizing or compressing images, Aspose.PDF for Java provides methods to perform these operations. You can refer to the documentation for more details on image manipulation.

## 7. Saving the Updated PDF

Once you have extracted and modified image properties as needed, you can save the updated PDF document using the following code:

```java
// Save the updated PDF document
pdfDocument.save("updated.pdf");
```

## 8. Conclusion

In this guide, we have learned how to extract image properties from a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for Java. We covered setting up the library, loading a PDF document, extracting image properties, accessing image information, and saving the updated PDF. Aspose.PDF for Java simplifies working with PDF documents and provides extensive functionality for various tasks.
