Learn how to set a destination link in PDF file using Aspose.PDF for .NET with this step-by-step guide.

## Step 1: Setting up the environment

Make sure you have set up your development environment with a C# project and the appropriate Aspose.PDF references.

## Step 2: Loading the PDF file

Set the directory path of your documents and upload the PDF file using the following code:

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";
// Load the PDF file
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "UpdateLinks.pdf");
```

## Step 3: Editing the destination link

Get the link annotation to modify using the following code:

```csharp
LinkAnnotation linkAnnot = (LinkAnnotation)doc.Pages[1].Annotations[1];
```

You can adjust the `[1]` indices to select a specific page or annotation.

Next, edit the link by changing the link action and setting the target as a web address:

```csharp
linkAnnot.Action = new GoToURIAction("www.aspose.com");
```

## Step 4: Save the document with the updated link

Save the document with the updated link using the `Save` method:

```csharp
dataDir = dataDir + "SetDestinationLink_out.pdf";
doc.Save(dataDir);
```

## Step 5: Displaying the result

Display a message indicating that the destination link was successfully configured and specify the location of the saved file:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nDestination link configured successfully.\nFile saved to location: " + dataDir);
```
