In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of converting an EPUB file to PDF using the Aspose.PDF library for .NET. EPUB (Electronic Publication) is a widely used format for electronic books, while PDF (Portable Document Format) is a document exchange standard. By following the steps given below, you will be able to convert EPUB files to PDF format effortlessly.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge of the C# programming language.
- Aspose.PDF library for .NET installed on your system.
- A development environment such as Visual Studio.

## Step 1: Upload EPUB file
At this step, we will upload the EPUB file using Aspose.PDF for .NET. Follow the code below:

```csharp
// Path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";

// Instantiate the LoadOption object using the EPUB load option
EpubLoadOptions epubload = new EpubLoadOptions();

// Create a Document object
Aspose.Pdf.Document pdf = new Aspose.Pdf.Document(dataDir + "EPUBToPDF.epub", epubload);
```

Be sure to replace `"YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY"` with the actual directory where your EPUB file is located.

## Step 2: EPUB to PDF conversion
Now that we have uploaded the EPUB file, we can proceed with the conversion to PDF. Use the following code:

```csharp
// Save the resulting PDF document
pdf. Save(dataDir + "EPUBToPDF_out.pdf");
```

The above code converts the EP file EPUB loaded in PDF format and saves it as filename `"EPUBToPDF_out.pdf"`. Be sure to provide the correct path and filename for the output PDF file.


Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY"` with the desired directory where you want to save the output PDF file.
