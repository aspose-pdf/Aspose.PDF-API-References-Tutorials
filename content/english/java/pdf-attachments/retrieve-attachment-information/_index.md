## Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use Aspose.PDF for Java to retrieve attachment information from a PDF document. Attachments can be files or documents embedded within a PDF, and you may need to access their details programmatically.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Java Development Environment (JDK) installed.
2. Aspose.PDF for Java library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/java/).

## Step 1: Create a Java Project

Create a new Java project in your favorite Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and include the Aspose.PDF for Java library in your project.

## Step 2: Load the PDF Document

First, you need to load the PDF document that contains the attachments. Use the following code to load a PDF file:

```java
// Load the PDF document
Document pdfDocument = new Document("path/to/your/pdf/document.pdf");
```

## Step 3: Retrieve Attachment Information

Now, you can retrieve attachment information from the loaded PDF document. Here's how you can get a list of attachments and display their details:

```java
// Get the collection of attachments
AttachmentCollection attachments = pdfDocument.getAttachments();

// Check if there are any attachments
if (attachments.size() > 0) {
    System.out.println("Attachments found:");

    // Iterate through each attachment
    for (Attachment attachment : attachments) {
        System.out.println("Name: " + attachment.getName());
        System.out.println("Description: " + attachment.getDescription());
        System.out.println("File Size: " + attachment.getFileSize() + " bytes");
        System.out.println("MIME Type: " + attachment.getMimeType());
        System.out.println("==================================");
    }
} else {
    System.out.println("No attachments found in the PDF.");
}
```

## Step 4: Save or Process Attachments

You can further process or save the attachments as needed. For example, you can extract and save them to a local directory or perform additional actions based on your application's requirements.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you have learned how to retrieve attachment information from a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for Java. You can now incorporate this functionality into your Java applications to work with PDF attachments effectively.
