## Introduction to Strike Through Text using Annotations

In the world of document manipulation, precision and clarity are paramount. Strikethrough text annotations are a valuable tool for highlighting changes, indicating deletions, or emphasizing specific content within a PDF document. Aspose.PDF for Java provides a robust set of features to achieve this effortlessly. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of adding strike-through text annotations to your PDF documents using Aspose.PDF for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Environment: Make sure you have Java and a suitable IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or any other) installed on your system.

2. Aspose.PDF for Java Library: Download and include the Aspose.PDF for Java library in your project. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/java/).

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Java Project

To get started, create a new Java project or open an existing one in your preferred IDE. Make sure you have added the Aspose.PDF for Java library to your project's classpath.

## Step 2: Initializing the PDF Document

Let's begin by initializing a PDF document where we want to add a strike-through annotation.

```java
// Initialize a new PDF document
com.aspose.pdf.Document pdfDocument = new com.aspose.pdf.Document();
```

## Step 3: Adding Text to the Document

Next, we'll add some text to the PDF document. This text will serve as the content we want to strike through.

```java
// Create a page in the PDF document
com.aspose.pdf.Page page = pdfDocument.getPages().add();

// Add text to the page
com.aspose.pdf.TextFragment textFragment = new com.aspose.pdf.TextFragment("This is a sample text to be struck through.");
page.getParagraphs().add(textFragment);
```

## Step 4: Adding a Strike-Through Annotation

Now comes the exciting part â€“ adding a strike-through annotation to the text.

```java
// Create a strike-through annotation
com.aspose.pdf.StrikeOutAnnotation strikeOutAnnotation = new com.aspose.pdf.StrikeOutAnnotation(page, textFragment.getRectangle());
strikeOutAnnotation.setColor(com.aspose.pdf.Color.getRed());

// Add the annotation to the page
page.getAnnotations().add(strikeOutAnnotation);
```

In this code snippet, we create a strike-through annotation, set its color to red (you can choose any color you prefer), and then add it to the PDF page.

## Step 5: Saving the PDF Document

Finally, we save the modified PDF document to a file.

```java
// Save the PDF document
pdfDocument.save("output.pdf");
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully added a strike-through text annotation to a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for Java. This powerful library simplifies the process of working with PDF documents, making it an ideal choice for developers seeking to enhance their document manipulation capabilities.
