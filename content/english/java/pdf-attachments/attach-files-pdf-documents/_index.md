## Introduction to Aspose.PDF for Java

Aspose.PDF for Java is a feature-rich library that enables developers to work with PDF documents in their Java applications. It offers a wide range of capabilities, including PDF creation, manipulation, and extraction.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Environment: Ensure that you have Java and a suitable IDE installed on your system.
- Aspose.PDF for Java: Download and install the Aspose.PDF for Java library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/java/).

## Setting up your Java project

To begin, create a new Java project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

## Adding Aspose.PDF to your project

1. Download the Aspose.PDF for Java library from the website.
2. Add the downloaded JAR file to your project's classpath.
3. You may also need to add any required dependencies, as specified in the Aspose.PDF documentation.

## Creating a PDF document

```java
// Specify the file to be attached
String filePath = "path/to/your/file.pdf";

// Create an attachment
FileAttachment fileAttachment = new FileAttachment(pdfDocument.getPages().get_Item(1), filePath);

// Set the attachment's appearance
fileAttachment.setIcon(FileIcon.Paperclip);
fileAttachment.setColor(Color.getBlue());

// Add the attachment to the PDF document
pdfDocument.getPages().get_Item(1).getAnnotations().add(fileAttachment);
```

## Saving the modified PDF

After attaching the files, save the modified PDF document to your desired location:

```java
// Save the PDF with attachments
pdfDocument.save("output.pdf");
```
