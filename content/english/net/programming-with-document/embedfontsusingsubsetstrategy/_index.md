## Introduction

In the digital age, PDFs have become a staple for sharing documents. Whether you're sending a report, a presentation, or an eBook, ensuring that your fonts are displayed correctly is crucial. Have you ever opened a PDF only to find that the text looks different than intended? This often happens when the fonts used in the document aren't embedded properly. That's where Aspose.PDF for .NET comes into play! In this tutorial, we'll explore how to embed fonts in a PDF file using the subset strategy, ensuring your documents look just as you intended, no matter where they're viewed.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty of embedding fonts, there are a few things you'll need to have in place:

1. Aspose.PDF for .NET: Make sure you have the Aspose.PDF library installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/net/).
2. Visual Studio: A development environment where you can write and test your .NET code.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will help you understand the code snippets better.

## Import Packages

To get started, you'll need to import the necessary packages in your C# project. Here’s how you can do it:

### Create a New Project

Open Visual Studio and create a new C# project. You can choose a Console Application for simplicity.

### Add Aspose.PDF Reference

1. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
2. Select "Manage NuGet Packages."
3. Search for "Aspose.PDF" and install the latest version.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```

Now that we have everything set up, let’s break down the process of embedding fonts into a PDF file step by step.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Document Directory

First things first, we need to define where our documents are stored. This is crucial because we’ll be reading from and writing to this directory.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path where your PDF files are located. This could be something like `@"C:\Documents\"`.

## Step 2: Load the PDF Document

Next, we’ll load the PDF document that we want to modify. This is where Aspose.PDF shines, allowing us to easily manipulate PDF files.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "input.pdf");
```

Make sure you have an `input.pdf` file in your specified directory. This file will be the one we modify.

## Step 3: Subset All Fonts

Now, let’s get to the heart of the matter: embedding fonts. We’ll start by embedding all fonts as subsets. This means that only the characters used in the document will be embedded, which can significantly reduce file size.

```csharp
// All fonts will be embedded as subset into document in case of SubsetAllFonts.
doc.FontUtilities.SubsetFonts(FontSubsetStrategy.SubsetAllFonts);
```

By using `SubsetAllFonts`, we ensure that every font used in the document is embedded, but only the characters that are actually used will be included.

## Step 4: Subset Embedded Fonts Only

In some cases, you might want to embed only the fonts that are already embedded in the document. This is useful if you want to maintain the original look without adding new fonts.

```csharp
// Font subset will be embedded for fully embedded fonts but fonts which are not embedded into document will not be affected.
doc.FontUtilities.SubsetFonts(FontSubsetStrategy.SubsetEmbeddedFontsOnly);
```

This line of code ensures that only the fonts that are already embedded will be subsetted, leaving any non-embedded fonts untouched.

## Step 5: Save the Modified Document

Finally, we need to save our changes. This is where we write the modified document back to the disk.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "Output_out.pdf");
```

This will create a new PDF file named `Output_out.pdf` in your specified directory, complete with the embedded fonts.

## Conclusion

And there you have it! You've successfully embedded fonts in a PDF file using Aspose.PDF for .NET. By following these steps, you can ensure that your documents maintain their intended appearance, regardless of where they're viewed. Whether you're sharing reports, presentations, or any other type of document, embedding fonts is a crucial step in maintaining professionalism and clarity.

## FAQ's

### What is font subsetting?
Font subsetting is the process of including only the characters used in a document, rather than the entire font, which helps reduce file size.

### Why should I embed fonts in my PDF?
Embedding fonts ensures that your document appears the same on all devices, preventing font substitution issues.

### Can I use Aspose.PDF for free?
Yes, Aspose offers a free trial that you can use to test the library before purchasing. You can find it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/).
