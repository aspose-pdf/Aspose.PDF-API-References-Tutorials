## Introduction

Creating interactive PDFs can significantly enhance user experience, especially when it comes to forms. One of the most common interactive elements is the radio button, which allows users to select one option from a set. In this tutorial, we will explore how to create radio buttons in a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for .NET. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, this guide will walk you through the process step-by-step, ensuring you understand each part of the code and its purpose.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the code, there are a few prerequisites you need to have in place:

1. Visual Studio: Ensure you have Visual Studio installed on your machine. This will be your development environment.
2. Aspose.PDF for .NET: You need to have the Aspose.PDF library. You can download it from the [site](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will help you understand the code snippets better.

## Import Packages

To get started, you need to import the necessary packages in your C# project. Here’s how you can do it:

### Create a New Project

Open Visual Studio and create a new C# project. You can choose a Console Application for simplicity.

### Add Aspose.PDF Reference

1. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
2. Select "Manage NuGet Packages."
3. Search for "Aspose.PDF" and install the latest version.

Now that you have everything set up, let’s dive into the code to create radio buttons in a PDF.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Document Directory

First, you need to specify the directory where your PDF will be saved. This is crucial for organizing your files.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path where you want to save your PDF file.

## Step 2: Instantiate the Document Object

Next, you need to create an instance of the `Document` class. This class represents your PDF document.

```csharp
Document pdfDocument = new Document();
```

This line initializes a new PDF document that you will be working with.

## Step 3: Add a Page to the PDF

Every PDF document consists of pages. You need to add at least one page to your document.

```csharp
pdfDocument.Pages.Add();
```

This line adds a new page to your PDF document, making it ready for content.

## Step 4: Create the Radio Button Field

Now, it’s time to create the radio button field. You will instantiate a `RadioButtonField` object and specify the page number where it will be placed.

```csharp
RadioButtonField radio = new RadioButtonField(pdfDocument.Pages[1]);
```

Here, we are adding the radio button to the first page of the PDF.

## Step 5: Add Options to the Radio Button

You can add multiple options to your radio button. Each option will be a selectable item.

```csharp
radio.AddOption("Test", new Rectangle(0, 0, 20, 20));
radio.AddOption("Test1", new Rectangle(20, 20, 40, 40));
```

In this example, we are adding two options: "Test" and "Test1". The `Rectangle` object specifies the position and size of each option.

## Step 6: Add the Radio Button to the Document Form

Once you have defined your radio button and its options, you need to add it to the form of the document.

```csharp
pdfDocument.Form.Add(radio);
```

This line integrates the radio button into the PDF form, making it interactive.

## Step 7: Save the PDF Document

Finally, you need to save your PDF document to the specified directory.

```csharp
dataDir = dataDir + "RadioButton_out.pdf";
pdfDocument.Save(dataDir);
```

This code saves the document with the name "RadioButton_out.pdf" in your specified directory.

## Step 8: Handle Exceptions

It’s always a good practice to handle exceptions that may occur during the execution of your code.

```csharp
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}
```

This will catch any errors and display the message, helping you debug if something goes wrong.
