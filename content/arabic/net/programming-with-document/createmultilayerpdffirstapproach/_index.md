In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of creating a multilayer PDF file using the first approach with Aspose.PDF for .NET. This approach allows you to add multiple layers to your PDF file. Follow the step-by-step guide below:

## Step 1: Initialize the PDF document

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Aspose.Pdf.Document pdf = new Aspose.Pdf.Document();
```

## Step 2: Add a new page to the document

```csharp
Aspose.Pdf.Page sec1 = pdf.Pages.Add();
```

## Step 3: Add a text fragment to the page

```csharp
Aspose.Pdf.Text.TextFragment t1 = new Aspose.Pdf.Text.TextFragment("paragraph 3 segment");
sec1.Paragraphs.Add(t1);
```

## Step 4: Customize the text fragment

```csharp
t1.Text = "paragraph 3 segment 1";
t1.TextState.ForegroundColor = Color.Red;
t1.TextState.FontSize = 12;
```

## Step 5: Add an image to the page

```csharp
Aspose.Pdf.Image image1 = new Aspose.Pdf.Image();
image1.File = dataDir + "test_image.png";
```

## Step 6: Add a floating box to the page

```csharp
Aspose.Pdf.FloatingBox box1 = new Aspose.Pdf.FloatingBox(117, 21);
sec1.Paragraphs.Add(box1);

box1.Left = -4;
box1.Top = -4;
box1.Paragraphs.Add(image1);
```

## Step 7: Save the resultant PDF document

```csharp
pdf.Save(dataDir + "CreateMultiLayerPdf_out.pdf");
```

Congratulations! You have successfully created a multilayer PDF document using the first approach with Aspose.PDF for .NET.

### Example source code for Create Multilayer PDF First Approach using Aspose.PDF for .NET:

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

Aspose.Pdf.Document pdf = new Aspose.Pdf.Document();
Aspose.Pdf.Page sec1 = pdf.Pages.Add();
Aspose.Pdf.Text.TextFragment t1 = new Aspose.Pdf.Text.TextFragment("paragraph 3 segment");
sec1.Paragraphs.Add(t1);

t1.Text = "paragraph 3 segment 1";
t1.TextState.ForegroundColor = Color.Red;
t1.TextState.FontSize = 12;

Aspose.Pdf.Image image1 = new Aspose.Pdf.Image();
image1.File = dataDir + "test_image.png";

Aspose.Pdf.FloatingBox box1 = new Aspose.Pdf.FloatingBox(117, 21);
sec1.Paragraphs.Add(box1);

box1.Left = -4;
box1.Top = -4;
box1.Paragraphs.Add(image1);

pdf.Save(dataDir + "CreateMultiLayerPdf_out.pdf");
```

### FAQ's for create multilayer PDF file first approach

#### Q: What is a multilayer PDF document?

A: A multilayer PDF document, also known as a layered PDF, contains multiple layers of content that can be individually controlled for visibility and opacity. Layers in a PDF document allow users to selectively show or hide specific content elements.

#### Q: How can I add layers to a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for .NET?

A: You can add layers to a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for .NET by creating floating boxes and adding content elements, such as text and images, to these boxes. Each floating box can represent a separate layer, and you can control their visibility and positioning on the page.

#### Q: What benefits does creating multilayer PDFs offer?

A: Creating multilayer PDFs provides enhanced flexibility and interactivity to the document. Layers allow you to organize and manage content elements effectively, making it easier to control their display and create interactive documents.

#### Q: Can I add multiple layers to a single page in the PDF document?

A: Yes, you can add multiple layers to a single page in the PDF document by creating and positioning multiple floating boxes. Each floating box can represent a separate layer, and you can add content elements to each box accordingly.

#### Q: Is Aspose.PDF for .NET suitable for professional projects involving multilayer PDFs?

A: Absolutely, Aspose.PDF for .NET is a robust and feature-rich library that is widely used in professional projects for PDF manipulation, including creating multilayer PDFs. It provides comprehensive functionalities for working with PDF documents in .NET applications.
