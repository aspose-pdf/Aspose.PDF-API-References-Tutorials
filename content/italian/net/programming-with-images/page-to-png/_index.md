## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Visual Studio or any other development environment installed and configured.
- A basic knowledge of the C# programming language.
- Aspose.PDF library for .NET installed. You can download it from Aspose official website.

## Step 1: Loading the PDF document

To get started, use the following code to load the PDF document:

// Open the document
Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "PageToPNG.pdf");
```

Be sure to provide the correct path to your PDF document.

## Step 2: Convert page to PNG

Next, we will convert a specific page of the PDF document to PNG format. Use the following code:

```csharp
using (FileStream imageStream = new FileStream(dataDir + "aspose-logo.png", FileMode.Create))
{
// Create a Resolution object
Resolution resolution = new Resolution(300);
// Create a PNG device with the specified attributes (Width, Height, Resolution)
PngDevice pngDevice = new PngDevice(resolution);
// Convert a specific page and save the image to the stream
pngDevice.Process(pdfDocument.Pages[1], imageStream);
// Close the stream
imageStream.Close();
}
```

Be sure to provide the desired path and filename for the output PNG image.
