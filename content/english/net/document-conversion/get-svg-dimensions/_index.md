## Introduction

Welcome to the world of Aspose.PDF for .NET! If you're looking to manipulate PDF files programmatically, you've landed in the right place. Aspose.PDF is a powerful library that allows developers to create, edit, and convert PDF documents with ease. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, this guide will walk you through the essentials of using Aspose.PDF for .NET, focusing on how to get SVG dimensions and convert them into PDF format.

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the code, there are a few things you need to have in place:

1. Visual Studio: Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your machine. It’s the IDE we’ll be using for this tutorial.
2. .NET Framework: Ensure you have the .NET Framework installed. Aspose.PDF supports various versions, so check the [documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/) for compatibility.
3. Aspose.PDF Library: You can download the latest version of Aspose.PDF for .NET from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/net/). If you want to try it out first, you can also get a [free trial](https://releases.aspose.com/).
4. Basic C# Knowledge: Familiarity with C# programming will help you understand the examples better.

## Import Packages

To get started, you need to import the necessary packages. Here’s how you can do it:

1. Open your Visual Studio project.
2. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer and select "Manage NuGet Packages."
3. Search for "Aspose.PDF" and install the package.

Once you have the package installed, you can start coding!

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project

### Create a New Project

First things first, let’s create a new C# project in Visual Studio.

- Open Visual Studio and select "Create a new project."
- Choose "Console App (.NET Framework)" and click "Next."
- Name your project (e.g., "AsposePDFExample") and click "Create."

### Add Using Directives

Now that your project is set up, you need to add the necessary using directives at the top of your `Program.cs` file:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using System;
using Aspose.Pdf;
```

This will allow you to access the classes and methods provided by the Aspose.PDF library.

## Step 2: Load the SVG Document

### Define the Document Directory

Before loading the SVG document, you need to specify the path to your documents directory. Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path where your SVG file is located.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

### Load the SVG Document

Now, let’s load the SVG document using the `SvgLoadOptions` class. This class allows you to adjust the page size based on the SVG content.

```csharp
var loadopt = new SvgLoadOptions();
loadopt.AdjustPageSize = true;
var svgDoc = new Document(dataDir + "GetSVGDimensions.svg", loadopt);
```

## Step 3: Adjust Page Margins

To ensure that the SVG content fits perfectly in the PDF, you need to set the page margins to zero. This step is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the SVG dimensions.

```csharp
svgDoc.Pages[1].PageInfo.Margin.Top = 0;
svgDoc.Pages[1].PageInfo.Margin.Left = 0;
svgDoc.Pages[1].PageInfo.Margin.Bottom = 0;
svgDoc.Pages[1].PageInfo.Margin.Right = 0;
```

## Step 4: Save the Document as PDF

Finally, it’s time to save the SVG document as a PDF. You can specify the output file name and path as follows:

```csharp
svgDoc.Save(dataDir + "GetSVGDimensions_out.pdf");
```

And that’s it! You’ve successfully converted an SVG file to a PDF using Aspose.PDF for .NET.
