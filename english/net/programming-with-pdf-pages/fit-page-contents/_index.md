In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the step-by-step process to adjust PDF page content using Aspose.PDF for .NET. We'll explain the bundled C# source code and provide you with a comprehensive guide to help you understand and implement this feature in your own projects. At the end of this tutorial, you will know how to adjust the content of PDF pages using Aspose.PDF for .NET.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A basic knowledge of the C# programming language
- Aspose.PDF for .NET installed in your development environment

## Step 1: Define the document directory
First, you need to set the path to your documents directory. This is the location where your input PDF file is located. Replace "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY" with the appropriate path.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 2: Load the PDF document
Then you can load the PDF document using the `Document` class of Aspose.PDF. Be sure to specify the correct path to the input PDF file.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "input.pdf");
```

## Step 3: Adjust page content
Now you can cycle through all the pages of the document and adjust the content of each page according to the size of the media box. In the example provided, we adjust the width of the page to render it in landscape mode (landscape) keeping the same height. The new width is calculated based on the aspect ratio of the media box.

```csharp
foreach(Page page in doc.Pages)
{
     Rectangle r = page.MediaBox;
     double newHeight = r.Height;
     double newWidth = r.Height * r.Height / r.Width;
}
```

### Sample source code for Fit Page Contents using Aspose.PDF for .NET 

```csharp

// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "input.pdf");
foreach (Page page in doc.Pages)
{
	Rectangle r = page.MediaBox;
	// New height the same
	double newHeight = r.Height;
	// New width is expanded proportionally to make orientation landscape
	// (we assume that previous orientation is portrait)
	double newWidth = r.Height * r.Height / r.Width;
}          

```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we learned how to adjust PDF page content using Aspose.PDF for .NET. By following the steps outlined above, you can easily implement this functionality in your own projects.
