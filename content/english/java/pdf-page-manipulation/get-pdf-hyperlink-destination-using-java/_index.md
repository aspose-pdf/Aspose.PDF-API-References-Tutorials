## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will explore how to get PDF hyperlink destinations using Java with the help of Aspose.PDF for Java. Hyperlinks are essential elements in PDF documents, allowing users to navigate to specific destinations within the PDF or external resources. We will walk through the process step by step, providing code examples and explanations.

## Understanding PDF Hyperlinks

PDF hyperlinks are interactive elements that allow users to click and navigate to different locations within the PDF document or external websites. They consist of two main components: the link annotation and the destination. The destination specifies where the hyperlink will take the user.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Java development environment
- Aspose.PDF for Java library
- Basic knowledge of Java programming

## Setting Up Aspose.PDF for Java

To get started, you need to set up Aspose.PDF for Java in your project. Follow these steps:
1. Download Aspose.PDF for Java from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/java/).
2. Add the Aspose.PDF library to your Java project.

## Loading a PDF Document

First, we'll load a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for Java. Here's the code to do that:

```java
// Load the PDF document
Document pdfDocument = new Document("sample.pdf");
```

## Retrieving Hyperlinks

Next, we need to retrieve the hyperlinks present in the PDF document. Aspose.PDF provides a convenient way to do this:

```java
// Get the collection of links from the first page
Page page = pdfDocument.getPages().get_Item(1);
LinkAnnotationCollection linkAnnotations = page.getAnnotations().getLinkAnnotations();
```

## Extracting Hyperlink Destinations

Now that we have the link annotations, we can extract the hyperlink destinations:

```java
// Extract and print hyperlink destinations
for (LinkAnnotation link : linkAnnotations) {
    String destination = link.getAction().getDestination();
    System.out.println("Hyperlink Destination: " + destination);
}
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to get PDF hyperlink destinations using Java and Aspose.PDF for Java. We covered the basics of PDF hyperlinks, set up the necessary environment, loaded a PDF document, retrieved hyperlinks, and extracted their destinations. This knowledge can be valuable for various PDF manipulation tasks in Java applications.
