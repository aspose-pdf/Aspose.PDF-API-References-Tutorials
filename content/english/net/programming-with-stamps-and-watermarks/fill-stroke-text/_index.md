## Introduction

Have you ever wanted to modify a PDF file to make it stand out? Maybe you need to add a striking watermark or a bold stamp that makes an important document unmistakably yours. With Aspose.PDF for .NET, you can easily fill stroke text in a PDF file, adding artistic flair that catches the eye. In today’s tutorial, we’ll walk through the process of doing just that—filling stroke text in a PDF using C#. By the end, you’ll have a solid grasp of how to manipulate PDF files like a pro.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the coding, there are a few things you’ll need to have in place to make this tutorial a breeze:

1. Visual Studio: Ensure you have Visual Studio installed on your machine since we’ll be writing C# code.
2. Aspose.PDF Library: Make sure you’ve downloaded the Aspose.PDF for .NET library. You can grab it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will help you understand the tutorial more easily.
4. Sample PDF File: You’ll need a sample PDF file (`input.pdf`) for testing purposes. You can create a simple one or use any existing PDF you have.

Now that we have everything in place, let’s get into the nitty-gritty of filling stroke text in your PDF file.

## Import Packages

To start, we'll need to import the necessary packages. Here's a brief overview of the essential imports for our project:

```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf.Text;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```

These packages will allow us to use the robust functionalities of the Aspose.PDF library.

Let’s break down the main task into clear steps. By following these steps, you can easily fill stroke text into your PDF files. 

## Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

First, ensure you have everything correctly set up in your Visual Studio project. Create a new project or choose an existing one. If you need assistance, here's how:

1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Create a new C# project (e.g., Console Application).
3. Right-click on the project in Solution Explorer, select “Manage NuGet Packages.”
4. Search for `Aspose.PDF` and install it.

## Step 2: Define Your Document Directory

Every journey needs a starting point, and in our case, it’s the documents directory where the input and output files will reside. 

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path where your input PDF file is located. 

## Step 3: Create the TextState Object

This step is where you begin to define the properties of the text you want to add. 

```csharp
TextState ts = new TextState();
```

The `TextState` object will hold the styling options for your stroke text.

## Step 4: Set the Color for Stroke

Next, you’ll want to define the color of the stroke for your text. 

```csharp
ts.StrokingColor = Color.Gray;
```

In this code, we’re using a gray color for the stroke. Feel free to change the color to suit your needs!

## Step 5: Configure Rendering Mode

To ensure your text displays as intended, set the rendering mode:

```csharp
ts.RenderingMode = TextRenderingMode.StrokeText;
```

This instructs the Aspose library that we’re working with stroke text.

## Step 6: Load Your Input PDF Document

Now it’s time to load the PDF file that you are going to modify. 

```csharp
Facades.PdfFileStamp fileStamp = new Facades.PdfFileStamp(new Aspose.Pdf.Document(dataDir + "input.pdf"));
```

Make sure your input PDF (`input.pdf`) is located in the documents directory defined in earlier steps.

## Step 7: Create a Stamp Object

Next, create a stamp that will hold your stroke text. 

```csharp
Aspose.Pdf.Facades.Stamp stamp = new Aspose.Pdf.Facades.Stamp();
```

This stamp will be used to overlay your text on the PDF.

## Step 8: Define the Text to Stamp

You’ll need to specify what text you want to add to the PDF:

```csharp
stamp.BindLogo(new Facades.FormattedText("PAID IN FULL", System.Drawing.Color.Gray, "Arial", Facades.EncodingType.Winansi, true, 78));
```

Here, “PAID IN FULL” is the text we’re adding, along with its styling attributes. Customize it as per your requirements!

## Step 9: Bind the Text State

Now, bind the `TextState` you defined previously to the stamp. 

```csharp
stamp.BindTextState(ts);
```

This step applies all the styles such as color and rendering mode to your text.

## Step 10: Set the Position of the Stamp

Determine where your stamp will appear in the PDF:

```csharp
stamp.SetOrigin(100, 100);
```

The arguments `(100, 100)` denote the X and Y coordinates (in points) for the origin of the text. Adjust these values to position your text perfectly!

## Step 11: Configure Opacity and Rotation

Here’s where you can play around with the appearance of your text:

```csharp
stamp.Opacity = 5;
stamp.BlendingSpace = Facades.BlendingColorSpace.DeviceRGB;
stamp.Rotation = 45.0F;
```

In this case, an opacity value and a rotation angle of 45 degrees add a unique flair to your text. Feel free to modify these settings for different effects.

## Step 12: Add the Stamp to the PDF

This is the crucial step where we finally add our stamp which includes the stroke text to the PDF:

```csharp
fileStamp.AddStamp(stamp);
```

And just like that, your text is ready to make a statement!

## Step 13: Save and Close the Document

Lastly, save your changes and ensure everything is cleaned up properly. 

```csharp
fileStamp.Save(dataDir + "output_out.pdf");
fileStamp.Close();
```

Your newly modified PDF file containing the stroke text will be saved as `output_out.pdf` in your documents directory. 

## Conclusion

And there you have it! By following these simple steps, you can easily fill stroke text in a PDF file using Aspose.PDF for .NET. Whether for business documents or personal projects, this technique allows you to add a unique touch to your PDFs, making them stand out in any stack of papers.
