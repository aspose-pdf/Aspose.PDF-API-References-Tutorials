In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of converting a PDF file to DOC format using Aspose.PDF for .NET. PDF files are commonly used to view and share documents universally, while DOC format is specific to Microsoft Word. By following the steps below, you will be able to convert PDF files to DOC format.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge of the C# programming language.
- Aspose.PDF library for .NET installed on your system.
- A development environment such as Visual Studio.

## Step 1: Opening the source PDF document
In this step, we will open the source PDF file using Aspose.PDF for .NET. Follow the code below:

```csharp
// Path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";

// Open the source PDF document
Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "PDFToDOC.pdf");
```

Be sure to replace `"YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY"` with the actual directory where your PDF file is located.

## Step 2: Convert PDF to DOC format
After opening the PDF file, we can proceed with the conversion to DOC format. Use the following code:

```csharp
// Save the file in MS document format
pdfDocument.Save(dataDir + "PDFToDOC_out.doc", SaveFormat.Doc);
```

The code above converts the PDF file to DOC format and saves it as the filename `"PDFToDOC_out.doc"`.

Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY"` with the desired directory where you want to save the output DOC file.
