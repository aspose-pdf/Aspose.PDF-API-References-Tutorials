## Introduction

Creating PDF documents on the fly can open up a world of possibilities for developers. Whether you need to generate reports, invoices, or any other form of documentation, being able to manipulate HTML elements and integrate them seamlessly into your PDFs is incredibly powerful. In this article, we’ll dive into how to add an HTML ordered list into documents using Aspose.PDF for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on this journey of PDF manipulation, let’s ensure you have everything in place. Here’s a quick rundown of what you will need:

1. .NET Development Environment: Make sure you have an IDE such as Visual Studio installed on your computer. This will be your playground for coding.
2. Aspose.PDF for .NET Library: You need to download and install the Aspose.PDF library. You can find the necessary files [here](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/net/). 
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Having some familiarity with C# programming will be beneficial as we will be coding in this language.
4. Access to the Documentation: To familiarize yourself with various functionalities of Aspose.PDF, it’s great to have the [Aspose.PDF for .NET documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/) handy for reference.

With our prerequisites covered, let’s get our hands dirty!

## Import Packages

First things first, you need to import the required packages in your C# application. This will allow you to access the classes and methods provided by the Aspose.PDF library. 

### Create a New Project

Open your Visual Studio and create a new Console Application project. Give it an appropriate name, like "PDFOrderedListDemo".

### Add Aspose.PDF Reference

1. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
2. Choose Manage NuGet Packages.
3. Search for "Aspose.PDF" and install the latest version.

### Import Required Namespaces

In your `Program.cs` file, start by adding the following using directive at the top:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```

Now we are all set to start building our PDF!

Ready to create a PDF with an HTML ordered list? Follow these steps.

## Step 1: Define Your Document and HTML Content

We'll start by setting up our PDF document and defining our HTML content that includes the ordered list.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
// The path to the output document.  
string outFile = dataDir + "AddHTMLOrderedListIntoDocuments_out.pdf";

// Instantiate Document object  
Document doc = new Document();
```

In this step, we set up the file paths for where we want to save our PDF document later.

## Step 2: Create the HTML Fragment

Next, we’ll create an `HtmlFragment` object that contains our HTML. Here we’ll include an ordered list along with some text.

```csharp
// Instantiate HtmlFragment object with corresponding HTML fragment  
HtmlFragment htmlFragment = new HtmlFragment("<body style='line-height: 100px;'><ul><li>First</li><li>Second</li><li>Third</li><li>Fourth</li><li>Fifth</li></ul>Text after the list.<br/>Next line<br/>Last line</body>");
```

Here we’ve created an HTML fragment that includes a list of items. The HTML is stored as a string, making it easy to manipulate.

## Step 3: Add a Page to the Document

Now, we need to add a page to our PDF document. Every PDF needs to have pages, and we’re no different!

```csharp
// Add Page in Pages Collection  
Page page = doc.Pages.Add();
```

This line of code adds a new page to our document. Remember, each page can hold various elements, including text, images, and our HTML content.

## Step 4: Insert the HTML Fragment into the Page

This is where the magic happens! Now we’ll add our previously defined HTML fragment to the page we just created.

```csharp
// Add HtmlFragment inside page  
page.Paragraphs.Add(htmlFragment);
```

By adding the HTML fragment to our page's paragraphs, we are essentially telling the PDF to render our HTML as it would appear in a web browser.

## Step 5: Save the PDF Document

With all of our content in place, the final step is to save the document to disk.

```csharp
// Save resultant PDF file  
doc.Save(outFile);
```

Here we call the `Save` method on our document object, specifying the output file path where our new PDF will live.

## Conclusion

Whether you’re generating reports, design documents, or personal projects, the ability to convert HTML content into a PDF format can greatly enrich your applications. Experiment with other HTML elements and see how far you can take your PDF creations!
