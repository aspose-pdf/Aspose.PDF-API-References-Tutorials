## Introduction

Have you ever opened a PDF file only to find that the zoom level is all wrong? It can be frustrating, especially when you're trying to focus on specific content. Luckily, with Aspose.PDF for .NET, you can easily set a default zoom level for your PDF documents. This guide will walk you through the process step-by-step, ensuring that your readers have the best experience possible when viewing your PDFs. So, grab your coding hat, and let’s dive in!

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, there are a few things you need to have in place:

1. Visual Studio: Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your machine. It’s the best environment for .NET development.
2. Aspose.PDF for .NET: You’ll need to download and install the Aspose.PDF library. You can find it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will help you understand the code snippets better.

## Import Packages

To begin, you need to import the necessary packages into your project. Here’s how you can do it:

### Create a New Project

Open Visual Studio and create a new C# project. You can choose a Console Application for simplicity.

### Add Aspose.PDF Reference

1. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
2. Select "Manage NuGet Packages."
3. Search for "Aspose.PDF" and install the latest version.

### Import the Namespace

At the top of your C# file, import the Aspose.PDF namespace:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Pdf.Annotations;
using Aspose.Pdf;
```

Now that you have everything set up, let’s move on to the actual coding!

## Step 1: Define the Document Directory

First things first, you need to specify the path to your documents directory. This is where your input PDF file will be located, and where the output file will be saved.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 2: Open the PDF Document

Next, you’ll want to open the PDF document that you want to modify. This is done using the `Document` class from the Aspose.PDF library.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "input.pdf");
```

## Step 3: Access the Outlines/Bookmarks Collection

Now, let’s get to the heart of the matter: the outlines or bookmarks of the PDF. These are the navigational elements that allow users to jump to specific sections of the document.

```csharp
OutlineItemCollection item = new OutlineItemCollection(doc.Outlines);
```

## Step 4: Set the Zoom Level

Here’s where the magic happens! You can set the zoom level using the `XYZExplicitDestination` class. In this example, we’ll set the zoom level to 0, which means the document will inherit the zoom level from the viewer.

```csharp
XYZExplicitDestination dest = new XYZExplicitDestination(2, 100, 100, 0);
```

## Step 5: Add the Action to the Outlines Collection

Now that you have your destination set, it’s time to add this action to the outlines collection of the PDF.

```csharp
item.Action = new GoToAction(dest);
```

## Step 6: Add the Item to the Outlines Collection

Next, you’ll want to add the item to the outlines collection of the PDF file. This step ensures that your changes are saved.

```csharp
doc.Outlines.Add(item);
```

## Step 7: Save the Output PDF

Finally, you need to save the modified PDF document. Specify the path where you want to save the new file.

```csharp
dataDir = dataDir + "InheritZoom_out.pdf";
doc.Save(dataDir);
```

## Step 8: Confirm the Update

To wrap things up, let’s print a confirmation message to the console to let us know that everything went smoothly.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nBookmarks updated successfully.\nFile saved at " + dataDir);
```

## Conclusion

And there you have it! You’ve successfully inherited the zoom level in your PDF files using Aspose.PDF for .NET. This simple yet powerful feature can greatly enhance the user experience, making your documents more accessible and easier to navigate. So, the next time you create a PDF, remember to set that zoom level!
