In this tutorial, we will take you step by step on how to extract text from a stamp annotation in a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for .NET. We'll show you how to use the provided C# source code to extract the text from a specific stamp annotation on a given page of the PDF document.

## Step 1: Setting up the environment

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- An installed .NET development environment.
- The Aspose.PDF library for .NET downloaded and referenced in your project.

## Step 2: Loading the PDF document

The first step is to load the existing PDF document into your project. Here's how:

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";

// Load the document
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "test.pdf");
```

Be sure to replace "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY" with the actual path to the directory where your PDF document is located.

## Step 3: Extract text from stamp annotation

Now that you have loaded the PDF document, you can extract the text from the specific stamp annotation. Here's how:

```csharp
// Retrieve buffer annotation
StampAnnotation annot = doc.Pages[1].Annotations[3] as StampAnnotation;

// Create a text absorber
TextAbsorber ta = new TextAbsorber();

// Visit the appearance of the annotation
XForm ap = annot. Appearance["N"];
ta.Visit(ap);

// Display the extracted text
Console.WriteLine(ta.Text);
```

The code above retrieves the stamp annotation from the specified page of the PDF document and then uses a text absorber to extract the text from the appearance of the annotation. The extracted text is then displayed in the output.

### Sample source code for Extract Text From Stamp Annotation using Aspose.PDF for .NET

XForm ap = annot.Appearance["N"];
ta.Visit(ap);
Console.WriteLine(ta.Text);

```
