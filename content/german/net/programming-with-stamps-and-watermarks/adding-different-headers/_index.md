In this tutorial, we will take you step by step on how to add different headers in PDF file using Aspose.PDF for .NET. We'll show you how to use the provided C# source code to add custom headers to each page of the PDF file.

## Step 1: Setting up the environment

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- An installed .NET development environment.
- The Aspose.PDF library for .NET downloaded and referenced in your project.

## Step 2: Loading the PDF document

The first step is to load the existing PDF document into your project. Here's how:

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";

// Open the source document
Aspose.Pdf.Document doc = new Aspose.Pdf.Document(dataDir + "AddingDifferentHeaders.pdf");
```

Be sure to replace "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY" with the actual path to the directory where your PDF document is located.

## Step 3: Creating Header Buffers

Now that you have uploaded the PDF document, you can create the header stamps to add. Here's how:

```csharp
// Create three header buffers
Aspose.Pdf.TextStamp stamp1 = new Aspose.Pdf.TextStamp("Header 1");
Aspose.Pdf.TextStamp stamp2 = new Aspose.Pdf.TextStamp("Header 2");
Aspose.Pdf.TextStamp stamp3 = new Aspose.Pdf.TextStamp("Header 3");
```

The above code creates three new header buffers containing the specified text.

## Step 4: Configuring header buffer properties

Before adding the header stamps to the PDF document, you can configure different properties for each stamp, such as alignment, size, color, etc. Here's how:

```csharp
// Configure the first header buffer
stamp1.VerticalAlignment = Aspose.Pdf.VerticalAlignment.Top;
stamp1.HorizontalAlignment = Aspose.Pdf.HorizontalAlignment.Center;
stamp1.TextState.FontStyle = FontStyles.Bold;
stamp1.TextState.ForegroundColor = Color.Red;
stamp1.TextState.FontSize = 14;

// Configuration of the second header buffer
stamp2.VerticalAlignment = Aspose.Pdf.VerticalAlignment.Top;
stamp2.HorizontalAlignment = Aspose.Pdf.HorizontalAlignment.Center;
stamp2.Zoom = 10;

// Configure third header buffer
stamp3.VerticalAlignment = Aspose.Pdf.VerticalAlignment.Top;
stamp3.HorizontalAlignment = Aspose.Pdf.HorizontalAlignment.Center;
stamp3.RotateAngle = 35;
stamp3.TextState.BackgroundColor = Color.Pink;
stamp3.TextState.Font = FontRepository.FindFont("Verdana");
```

You can adjust these properties as needed for each header buffer.

## Step 5: Add Header Stamps to PDF

Now that the header stamps are ready, you can add them to each specific page of the PDF document. Here's how:

```csharp
// Add header buffers to specific pages
doc.Pages[1].AddStamp(stamp1);
doc.Pages[2].AddStamp(stamp2);
doc.Pages[3].AddStamp(stamp3);
```

The code above adds each header stamp to the corresponding page of the PDF document.

## Step 6: Save the output document

Once you have added the header stamps, you can save the edited PDF document. Here's how:

```csharp
// Save the updated document
doc.Save(dataDir);
```

The above code saves the edited PDF document to the specified directory.

### Sample source code for Adding Different Headers using Aspose.PDF for .NET 
```csharp

// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

// Open source document
Aspose.Pdf.Document doc = new Aspose.Pdf.Document(dataDir+ "AddingDifferentHeaders.pdf");

// Create three stamps
Aspose.Pdf.TextStamp stamp1 = new Aspose.Pdf.TextStamp("Header 1");
Aspose.Pdf.TextStamp stamp2 = new Aspose.Pdf.TextStamp("Header 2");
Aspose.Pdf.TextStamp stamp3 = new Aspose.Pdf.TextStamp("Header 3");

// Set stamp alignment (place stamp on page top, centered horiznotally)
stamp1.VerticalAlignment = Aspose.Pdf.VerticalAlignment.Top;
stamp1.HorizontalAlignment = Aspose.Pdf.HorizontalAlignment.Center;

// Specify the font style as Bold
stamp1.TextState.FontStyle = FontStyles.Bold;

// Set the text fore ground color information as red
stamp1.TextState.ForegroundColor = Color.Red;

// Specify the font size as 14
stamp1.TextState.FontSize = 14;

// Now we need to set the vertical alignment of 2nd stamp object as Top
stamp2.VerticalAlignment = Aspose.Pdf.VerticalAlignment.Top;

// Set Horizontal alignment information for stamp as Center aligned
stamp2.HorizontalAlignment = Aspose.Pdf.HorizontalAlignment.Center;

// Set the zooming factor for stamp object
stamp2.Zoom = 10;

// Set the formatting of 3rd stamp object
// Specify the Vertical alignment information for stamp object as TOP
stamp3.VerticalAlignment = Aspose.Pdf.VerticalAlignment.Top;

// Set the Horizontal alignment inforamtion for stamp object as Center aligned
stamp3.HorizontalAlignment = Aspose.Pdf.HorizontalAlignment.Center;

// Set the rotation angle for stamp object
stamp3.RotateAngle = 35;

// Set pink as background color for stamp
stamp3.TextState.BackgroundColor = Color.Pink;

// Change the font face information for stamp to Verdana
stamp3.TextState.Font = FontRepository.FindFont("Verdana");

// First stamp is added on first page;
doc.Pages[1].AddStamp(stamp1);

// Second stamp is added on second page;
doc.Pages[2].AddStamp(stamp2);

// Third stamp is added on third page.
doc.Pages[3].AddStamp(stamp3);
dataDir = dataDir + "multiheader_out.pdf";

// Save the updated document
doc.Save(dataDir);
Console.WriteLine("\nDifferent headers added successfully.\nFile saved at " + dataDir);

```

## Conclusion

Congratulation ! You have learned how to add different headers to each page of a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for .NET. You can now apply this knowledge to your own projects to customize headers for your PDF documents.

### FAQ's for adding different headers in PDF file

#### Q: What is the purpose of adding different headers in a PDF file using Aspose.PDF for .NET?

A: Adding different headers to a PDF file using Aspose.PDF for .NET allows you to customize the content displayed at the top of each page. This feature is particularly useful for adding titles, section names, page numbers, and other information that varies across different pages of a PDF document.

#### Q: Can I customize the appearance of each header, such as alignment, font, size, color, and rotation?

A: Yes, you can fully customize the appearance of each header stamp. The provided C# source code demonstrates how to set various properties of the `TextStamp` objects for each header, including vertical and horizontal alignment, font style, font size, font color, background color, and rotation angle.

#### Q: Is it possible to add multiple header stamps to the same page of a PDF document?

A: While the provided tutorial demonstrates adding different headers to distinct pages of a PDF document, you can adapt the code to add multiple header stamps to the same page. This could be useful if you want to display varied headers within the same section.

#### Q: How can I ensure that the headers do not overlap with the main content of the PDF pages?

A: To prevent overlapping, you can adjust the `VerticalAlignment`, `HorizontalAlignment`, and other properties of the `TextStamp` objects. These settings will control where the headers are positioned on the page, allowing you to position them in a way that does not obstruct the main content.

#### Q: Can I use this method to add headers to existing PDF documents with varying numbers of pages?

A: Yes, you can adapt the provided source code to add headers to existing PDF documents with varying numbers of pages. Simply adjust the code to match the number of headers you want to add and associate each header with the desired page.

#### Q: What if I want to add headers to specific pages, not just the first three pages?

A: The tutorial demonstrates adding headers to the first three pages for illustrative purposes. To add headers to specific pages beyond the first three, adjust the code by referencing the corresponding page indices and creating `TextStamp` objects for each page.

#### Q: Can I use images as headers instead of text?

A: The provided tutorial focuses on adding text-based headers. However, you can apply a similar approach to add image-based headers using `ImageStamp` objects instead of `TextStamp` objects. This would involve creating and configuring `ImageStamp` objects with desired properties.

#### Q: How can I apply this knowledge to add different footers to each page of a PDF document?

A: The same approach demonstrated in this tutorial can be applied to add different footers to each page of a PDF document. Instead of headers, you would create and configure `TextStamp` or `ImageStamp` objects and add them to the bottom of each page using the `AddStamp` method.

#### Q: Can I automate the process of adding headers to multiple PDF documents in a batch operation?

A: Yes, you can automate the process of adding headers to multiple PDF documents using a script or program that iterates through a list of documents and applies the header stamping process to each document.
