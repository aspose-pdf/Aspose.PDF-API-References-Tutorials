## Introduction

Have you ever found yourself needing to attach a file to a PDF document? Whether it's a supplementary text file, an image, or any other type of document, adding attachments to PDFs can enhance the usability and functionality of your files. In this tutorial, we will explore how to add attachments to PDF files using Aspose.PDF for .NET. This powerful library allows developers to manipulate PDF documents with ease, and by the end of this guide, you'll be able to add attachments like a pro!

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty of adding attachments, there are a few prerequisites you need to have in place:

1. Aspose.PDF for .NET: Ensure you have the Aspose.PDF library installed. You can download it from the [site](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/net/).
2. Visual Studio: A development environment where you can write and test your .NET code.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will help you understand the code snippets better.

## Import Packages

To get started, you need to import the necessary packages in your C# project. Here’s how you can do it:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using System;
using Aspose.Pdf;
```

Once you have the package installed, you can start writing your code.

Now that we have everything set up, let’s break down the process of adding an attachment to a PDF file into manageable steps.

## Step 1: Define the Document Directory

The first step is to define the path to your documents directory. This is where your PDF file and the file you want to attach will be located.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

Make sure to replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path where your files are stored.

## Step 2: Open the PDF Document

Next, you need to open the PDF document to which you want to add the attachment. This is done using the `Document` class provided by Aspose.PDF.

```csharp
// Open document
Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "AddAttachment.pdf");
```

In this line, we are creating a new instance of the `Document` class and loading the existing PDF file named `AddAttachment.pdf`.

## Step 3: Setup the File to be Attached

Now, it’s time to specify the file you want to attach. You’ll need to create a `FileSpecification` object that contains the path to the file and a description.

```csharp
// Setup new file to be added as attachment
FileSpecification fileSpecification = new FileSpecification(dataDir + "test.txt", "Sample text file");
```

Here, we are preparing to attach a text file named `test.txt` with a description of "Sample text file."

## Step 4: Add the Attachment to the Document

With the file specification ready, you can now add the attachment to the PDF document's attachment collection.

```csharp
// Add attachment to document's attachment collection
pdfDocument.EmbeddedFiles.Add(fileSpecification);
```

This line of code adds the specified file as an embedded file in the PDF document.

## Step 5: Save the Updated Document

After adding the attachment, you need to save the updated PDF document. Specify the output path where you want to save the new file.

```csharp
dataDir = dataDir + "AddAttachment_out.pdf";
// Save new output
pdfDocument.Save(dataDir);
```

In this step, we are saving the modified PDF as `AddAttachment_out.pdf` in the same directory.

## Step 6: Confirm the Operation

Finally, it’s always a good practice to confirm that the operation was successful. You can do this by printing a message to the console.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nSample text file attached successfully.\nFile saved at " + dataDir);
```

This message will let you know that the attachment was added successfully and where the new file is located.
