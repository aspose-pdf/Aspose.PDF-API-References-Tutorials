## Introduction

In the world of document processing, ensuring that your PDFs look exactly as intended is crucial. Have you ever opened a PDF only to find that the fonts are all wrong? This can happen when the original fonts used in the document aren't available on the system where the PDF is being viewed. Fortunately, Aspose.PDF for .NET provides a robust solution to detect font substitution warnings, allowing you to maintain the integrity of your documents. In this guide, we’ll walk through the steps to set up font substitution detection in your PDF documents using Aspose.PDF for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the code, there are a few things you need to have in place:

1. Visual Studio: Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your machine. This is where you’ll write and run your .NET code.
2. Aspose.PDF for .NET: You need to have the Aspose.PDF library. You can download it from the [site](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will help you understand the code snippets better.
4. A PDF Document: Have a sample PDF document ready that you can use to test font substitution detection.

## Import Packages

To get started, you need to import the necessary packages in your C# project. Here’s how you can do it:

### Create a New Project

Open Visual Studio and create a new C# project. You can choose a Console Application for simplicity.

### Add Aspose.PDF Reference

1. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
2. Select "Manage NuGet Packages."
3. Search for "Aspose.PDF" and install the latest version.

### Import the Namespace

At the top of your C# file, import the Aspose.PDF namespace:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```

Now that you have everything set up, let’s break down the process of detecting font substitution warnings into manageable steps.

## Step 1: Define the Document Path

First, you need to specify the path to your PDF document. This is where Aspose.PDF will look for the file.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path where your PDF file is located.

## Step 2: Open the PDF Document

Next, you’ll open the PDF document using the `Document` class provided by Aspose.PDF.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "input.pdf");
```

This line of code initializes a new `Document` object with your PDF file.

## Step 3: Set Up Font Substitution Detection

Now, it’s time to set up the event handler that will detect font substitution warnings. You’ll need to subscribe to the `FontSubstitution` event of the `Document` class.

```csharp
doc.FontSubstitution += new Document.FontSubstitutionHandler(OnFontSubstitution);
```

This line connects the event to your custom method, which we’ll define next.

## Step 4: Handle Font Substitution Warnings

You need to create a method that will handle the font substitution warnings. This method will be called whenever a font substitution occurs.

```csharp
private void OnFontSubstitution(object sender, Document.FontSubstitutionEventArgs e)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Font substitution: {0} => {1}", e.OriginalFontName, e.SubstitutedFontName);
}
```

In this method, you can log the original font name and the substituted font name to the console. This way, you’ll know exactly what changes were made.

## Step 5: Run the Code

Finally, you can run your application. If there are any font substitutions in your PDF document, you’ll see the warnings printed in the console.

## Conclusion

Detecting font substitution warnings in PDF documents is essential for maintaining the visual integrity of your files. With Aspose.PDF for .NET, this process is straightforward and efficient. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can easily set up font substitution detection and ensure that your PDFs look just as you intended.

## FAQ's
