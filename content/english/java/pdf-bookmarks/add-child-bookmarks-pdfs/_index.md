## Introduction to Add Child Bookmarks to PDFs

In this article, we will explore how to add child bookmarks to PDF documents using Aspose.PDF for Java. Child bookmarks are a convenient way to organize and navigate through the content of a PDF document, making it easier for users to find specific sections or topics within the document.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the implementation, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java development environment installed on your system.
- Aspose.PDF for Java library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/java/).

## Setting Up the Environment

1. Download the Aspose.PDF for Java library from the provided link.
2. Add the library to your Java project.

Now, let's start by creating a new PDF document and adding child bookmarks to it step by step.

## Creating a New PDF Document

To begin, we need to initialize a PDF document and add pages to it. Here's the code snippet to get started:

```java
// Initialize a PDF document
Document pdfDocument = new Document();

// Add pages to the PDF
pdfDocument.getPages().add();
pdfDocument.getPages().add();
```

In this example, we've created a new PDF document and added two pages to it.

## Adding Parent Bookmarks

Parent bookmarks serve as the main sections or categories in your PDF document. Let's create some parent bookmarks:

```java
// Create parent bookmarks
OutlineItemCollection outline = pdfDocument.getOutlines();
OutlineItemCollection parentBookmark = new OutlineItemCollection(outline);
parentBookmark.setTitle("Parent Bookmark 1");
outline.add(parentBookmark);

parentBookmark = new OutlineItemCollection(outline);
parentBookmark.setTitle("Parent Bookmark 2");
outline.add(parentBookmark);
```

We've added two parent bookmarks, "Parent Bookmark 1" and "Parent Bookmark 2."

## Adding Child Bookmarks

Now, it's time to add child bookmarks to the parent bookmarks we created earlier. Child bookmarks represent specific topics or sub-sections within each parent bookmark. Here's how you can do it:

```java
// Add child bookmarks to Parent Bookmark 1
OutlineItemCollection childBookmark = new OutlineItemCollection(outline);
childBookmark.setTitle("Child Bookmark 1.1");
parentBookmark.add(childBookmark);

childBookmark = new OutlineItemCollection(outline);
childBookmark.setTitle("Child Bookmark 1.2");
parentBookmark.add(childBookmark);

// Add child bookmarks to Parent Bookmark 2
childBookmark = new OutlineItemCollection(outline);
childBookmark.setTitle("Child Bookmark 2.1");
parentBookmark.add(childBookmark);
```

We've added child bookmarks to both "Parent Bookmark 1" and "Parent Bookmark 2."

## Customizing Bookmark Appearance

You can customize the appearance of bookmarks by changing their text and style. Additionally, you can add icons to bookmarks for better visual representation. Here's an example of how to do it:

```java
// Customize bookmark appearance
parentBookmark.setItalic(true);
childBookmark.setForegroundColor(Color.getGreen());
childBookmark.setIcon(OutlineItemCollection.getItalicIcon());
```

In this example, we've made the parent bookmark italic, changed the text color of the child bookmark to green, and added an italic icon to the child bookmark.

## Handling Events

Bookmarks can also have actions associated with them. For example, you can add actions that trigger when a user clicks on a bookmark. Here's how you can handle bookmark click events:

```java
// Add an action to a bookmark
GoToAction action = new GoToAction(pdfDocument.getPages().get_Item(1));
childBookmark.setAction(action);
```

In this code, we've added a "GoTo" action to a child bookmark that will take the user to the second page of the PDF when clicked.

## Saving the PDF

Once you've added all the necessary bookmarks and customized their appearance and actions, you can save the modified PDF document:

```java
// Save the PDF document
pdfDocument.save("output.pdf");
```

Your PDF document with child bookmarks is now ready.

## Complete Source Code

Here's the complete source code for adding child bookmarks to a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for Java:

```java
// Initialize a PDF document
Document pdfDocument = new Document();

// Add pages to the PDF
pdfDocument.getPages().add();
pdfDocument.getPages().add();

// Create parent bookmarks
OutlineItemCollection outline = pdfDocument.getOutlines();
OutlineItemCollection parentBookmark = new OutlineItemCollection(outline);
parentBookmark.setTitle("Parent Bookmark 1");
outline.add(parentBookmark);

parentBookmark = new OutlineItemCollection(outline);
parentBookmark.setTitle("Parent Bookmark 2");
outline.add(parentBookmark);

// Add child bookmarks to Parent Bookmark 1
OutlineItemCollection childBookmark = new OutlineItemCollection(outline);
childBookmark.setTitle("Child Bookmark 1.1");
parentBookmark.add(childBookmark);

childBookmark = new OutlineItemCollection(outline);
childBookmark.setTitle("Child Bookmark 1.2");
parentBookmark.add(childBookmark);

// Add child bookmarks to Parent Bookmark 2
childBookmark = new OutlineItemCollection(outline);
childBookmark.setTitle("Child Bookmark 2.1");
parentBookmark.add(childBookmark);

// Customize bookmark appearance
parentBookmark.setItalic(true);
childBookmark.setForegroundColor(Color.getGreen());
childBookmark.setIcon(OutlineItemCollection.getItalicIcon());

// Add an action to a bookmark
GoToAction action = new GoToAction(pdfDocument.getPages().get_Item(1));
childBookmark.setAction(action);

// Save the PDF document
pdfDocument.save("output.pdf");
```
