## Introduction

Creating PDFs with rich visual components can be both challenging and rewarding. Have you ever found yourself needing to manipulate the visual elements of a PDF, perhaps needing to layer shapes or adjust the order in which they appear? This tutorial dives into the fascinating world of PDF manipulation using Aspose.PDF for .NET, focusing specifically on controlling the Z-order of rectangles in a PDF document. 

## Prerequisites 

Before we jump into the code, there are a few things you’ll need to ensure you have set up:

1. IDE for .NET Development: If you haven't already, choose and install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider. These tools will help you write, test, and debug your code efficiently.
2. Aspose.PDF for .NET Library: You can get started by downloading the Aspose.PDF library. Visit the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/net/) to grab the latest version. This library is essential for creating and manipulating PDF documents.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: While this guide will walk you through everything, having a basic understanding of C# will help you grasp the concepts more quickly.
4. .NET Framework: Ensure you have the .NET framework installed on your machine. You can find the necessary requirements in the [Aspose documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/net/).

Now that we've covered the prerequisites, let's move on to the fun part—importing the packages we’ll be working with.

## Import Packages

In our projects, we must import the necessary Aspose.PDF namespace to access its classes and methods. This will allow us to manipulate PDF files seamlessly. Here's how you do it:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using System;
using Aspose.Pdf;
```

By including these namespaces at the top of your code file, you can access all the functionalities provided by Aspose.PDF.

Now, let's break down the tutorial into manageable steps. Each step will guide you through the process of adding rectangles to a PDF and controlling their Z-order.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Document

Before we can add shapes, we need to set up the foundation of our PDF document. This involves defining where the document is stored and initializing it.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

// Instantiate Document class object
Document doc1 = new Document();
```
Here, you start by defining the directory where you want to save your PDF. The `Document` class from Aspose.PDF is then instantiated, which will serve as the main object for your PDF file.

## Step 2: Add a Page to Your Document

Every PDF needs at least one page to display content. Let’s add a page and set its dimensions.

```csharp
// Add page to pages collection of PDF file
Aspose.Pdf.Page page1 = doc1.Pages.Add();
// Set size of PDF page
page1.SetPageSize(375, 300);
```
In this step, we use the `Add()` method to create a new page within our document. We also set the page size to 375px by 300px, giving us a canvas to work with.

## Step 3: Set Page Margins 

Margins are essential because they define the usable space on your PDF page. Here’s how you can set them:

```csharp
// Set left margin for page object as 0
page1.PageInfo.Margin.Left = 0;
// Set top margin of page object as 0
page1.PageInfo.Margin.Top = 0;
```
By setting the left and top margins to zero, we ensure that our shapes will take up the full area of the page.

## Step 4: Add Rectangles with Z-order Control

Now the exciting part—adding rectangles! Each rectangle can have a designated Z-order. The Z-order determines which rectangle appears on top of others. We'll define a method for adding rectangles.

```csharp
void AddRectangle(Aspose.Pdf.Page page, float x, float y, float width, float height, Aspose.Pdf.Color color, int zOrder)
{
    // Create a new rectangle
    Aspose.Pdf.Rectangle rectangle = new Aspose.Pdf.Rectangle(x, y, x + width, y + height);
    // Create the graph for the page
    Aspose.Pdf.Operators.Graph graph = new Aspose.Pdf.Operators.Graph(page);
    graph.ZOrder = zOrder; // Set Z-Order of the rectangle
    // Create a color brush
    Pen pen = new Pen(color);
    graph.DrawRectangle(pen, rectangle);
}
```
This method takes in parameters for positioning, size, color, and Z-order, allowing flexibility in how shapes are drawn on the page.

## Step 5: Use the AddRectangle Method

Now we can create rectangles on our page using the method we defined above.

```csharp
// Create a new rectangle with Color as Red, Z-Order as 0 and certain dimensions
AddRectangle(page1, 50, 40, 60, 40, Aspose.Pdf.Color.Red, 2);
// Create a new rectangle with Color as Blue, Z-Order as 0 and certain dimensions
AddRectangle(page1, 20, 20, 30, 30, Aspose.Pdf.Color.Blue, 1);
// Create a new rectangle with Color as Green, Z-Order as 0 and certain dimensions
AddRectangle(page1, 40, 40, 60, 30, Aspose.Pdf.Color.Green, 0);
```
Here, we’re adding three rectangles with varying colors and Z-order values. The rectangle with the highest Z-order will appear on top when viewed in the PDF.

## Step 6: Save the Document 

At last, it’s time to save your masterpiece! Here’s how to do it:

```csharp
dataDir = dataDir + "ControlRectangleZOrder_out.pdf";
// Save resultant PDF file
doc1.Save(dataDir);
```
You simply specify the file name and call the `Save()` method to create your PDF document.

## Conclusion 

And just like that, you’ve learned how to control the Z-order of rectangles in a PDF using Aspose.PDF for .NET! The ability to layer shapes and manipulate their visual order can significantly enhance the usability and aesthetics of your PDF documents. Whether you're generating reports, creating educational materials, or even just having fun with graphics, these techniques can be applied broadly.

Remember, practice is key! Play around with different shapes, sizes, and colors. The more you experiment, the more comfortable you’ll become with the tools at your disposal.
