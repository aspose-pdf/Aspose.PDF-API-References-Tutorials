Updating bookmarks in PDF file is often necessary to reflect changes or updates in the structure or content of the document. With Aspose.PDF for .NET, you can easily update bookmarks by following the following source code:

## Step 1: Import required libraries

Before you begin, you need to import the necessary libraries for your C# project. Here is the necessary import directive:

```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf;
```

## Step 2: Set path to documents folder

In this step, you need to specify the path to the folder containing the PDF file you want to update. Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` in the following code with the actual path to your documents folder:

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 3: Open the PDF document

Now we will open the PDF document we want to update using the following code:

```csharp
Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "UpdateBookmarks.pdf");
```

## Step 4: Get bookmark object

In this step, we'll get the specific bookmark object we want to update. In the example below, we retrieve the bookmark at index 1 (the second bookmark in the bookmarks collection). You can adjust the index according to your needs. Here is the corresponding code:

```csharp
OutlineItemCollection pdfOutline = pdfDocument.Outlines[1];
```

## Step 5: Update bookmark properties

Now let's update the bookmark properties such as title, italic style, and bold style. You can adjust these properties according to your needs. Here is the corresponding code:

```csharp
pdfOutline.Title = "Updated Outline";
pdfOutline. Italic = true;
pdfOutline. Bold = true;
```

## Step 6: Save the updated file

Now let's save the updated PDF file using the `Save` method of the `pdfDocument` object. Here is the corresponding code:

```csharp
dataDir = dataDir + "UpdateBookmarks_out.pdf";
pdfDocument.Save(dataDir);
```
