Learn how to specify a page when viewing a PDF file using Aspose.PDF for .NET with this step-by-step guide.

## Step 1: Setting up the environment

Make sure you have set up your development environment with a C# project and the appropriate Aspose.PDF references.

## Step 2: Loading the PDF file

Set the directory path of your documents and upload the PDF file using the following code:

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";
// Load the PDF file
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "SpecifyPageWhenViewing.pdf");
```

## Step 3: Specifying the target page

Get the target page instance using the following code:

```csharp
Page page2 = doc.Pages[2];
```

You can adjust the index `[2]` to select the desired page.

## Step 4: Configuring the zoom setting

Create a variable to set the target page zoom factor:

```csharp
double zoom = 1;
```

You can adjust the zoom value according to your needs.

## Step 5: Create the navigation action

Create an instance of the navigation action using the specified target page:

```csharp
GoToAction action = new GoToAction(doc.Pages[2]);
```

## Step 6: Setting the destination

Set the destination to go to the target page using coordinates and zoom:

```csharp
action.Destination = new XYZExplicitDestination(page2, 0, page2.Rect.Height, zoom);
```

## Step 7: Configuring the Document Open Action

Set the document open action with the created navigation action:

```csharp
doc. OpenAction = action;
```

## Step 8: Save the updated document

Save the updated document using the `Save` method:

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "goto2page_out.pdf");
```
