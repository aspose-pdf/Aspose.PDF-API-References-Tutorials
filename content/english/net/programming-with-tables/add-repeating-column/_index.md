## Introduction

If you're working with PDF documents and need to add repeating columns, you're in the right place! Using Aspose.PDF for .NET, you can easily manage tables and content within a PDF. Whether you're building dynamic reports, invoices, or any other structured document, repeating columns can be a game-changer in organizing data. Let's dive into a step-by-step guide on how to add repeating columns to a PDF document.

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the code, let’s make sure you have everything set up:

- Aspose.PDF for .NET: You need to have the Aspose.PDF for .NET library installed in your project.
- [Download Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/net/)
- [Free Trial](https://releases.aspose.com/)
- Development Environment: Ensure you have a .NET compatible IDE such as Visual Studio installed.
- Basic Understanding of C#: While we’ll break everything down, a basic understanding of C# will help you follow along smoothly.
  
If you don’t have Aspose.PDF for .NET yet, you can get a [temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) to start exploring its features.

## Import Packages

To begin, you need to import the necessary namespaces from Aspose.PDF for .NET. Here’s how you do it:

```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf;
using Aspose.Pdf.Text;
```

These packages provide the essential classes and methods required to work with PDF documents and manipulate tables.

Now, let's break the process down into multiple steps to add repeating columns to a PDF document. Follow along!

## Step 1: Set the Path to Your Documents Directory

Before we create or manipulate any files, we need to define the path where the generated PDF will be saved. In your C# project, set the directory path to where your files will be located:

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
string outFile = dataDir + "AddRepeatingColumn_out.pdf";
```

This path points to the directory where the output PDF will be saved. Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path on your machine.

## Step 2: Create a New PDF Document

To begin, instantiate a new `Document` object. This will serve as the container for all pages and content within the PDF.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
Aspose.Pdf.Page page = doc.Pages.Add();
```

Here, we’ve created a new PDF document and added a blank page to it. The `doc.Pages.Add()` method inserts a new page into the document.

## Step 3: Instantiate the Outer Table

Next, we create an outer table. This table will span the entire width of the page and serve as a container for other tables, including the one that will contain the repeating columns.

```csharp
Aspose.Pdf.Table outerTable = new Aspose.Pdf.Table();
outerTable.ColumnWidths = "100%";
outerTable.HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Left;
```

We’ve set the `ColumnWidths` property to "100%", meaning the table will stretch across the whole page width.

## Step 4: Create the Inner Table

Now, let’s create the inner table, which will have repeating columns. The key properties here are `Broken`, which allows the table to continue across the same page, and `ColumnAdjustment`, which automatically adjusts the column widths to fit the content.

```csharp
Aspose.Pdf.Table mytable = new Aspose.Pdf.Table();
mytable.Broken = TableBroken.VerticalInSamePage;
mytable.ColumnAdjustment = ColumnAdjustment.AutoFitToContent;
```

This inner table will be nested within the outer table.

## Step 5: Add Tables to the Page

Now that we have both the outer and inner tables ready, let’s add them to the page. This step ensures that the tables are included in the document's structure.

```csharp
page.Paragraphs.Add(outerTable);
var bodyRow = outerTable.Rows.Add();
var bodyCell = bodyRow.Cells.Add();
bodyCell.Paragraphs.Add(mytable);
mytable.RepeatingColumnsCount = 5;
```

Here, we added the `outerTable` to the page, and then within the outer table, we nested the `mytable`. Additionally, we set `RepeatingColumnsCount` to 5, specifying how many columns should repeat when data is added.

## Step 6: Add Header Row

Now it’s time to add the headers to the table. The header row gives context to the data and helps structure the columns. 

```csharp
Aspose.Pdf.Row row = mytable.Rows.Add();
row.Cells.Add("header 1");
row.Cells.Add("header 2");
row.Cells.Add("header 3");
row.Cells.Add("header 4");
row.Cells.Add("header 5");
row.Cells.Add("header 6");
row.Cells.Add("header 7");
row.Cells.Add("header 11");
row.Cells.Add("header 12");
row.Cells.Add("header 13");
row.Cells.Add("header 14");
row.Cells.Add("header 15");
row.Cells.Add("header 16");
row.Cells.Add("header 17");
```

This code snippet adds the first row (which we’ll use as headers), and populates it with cells containing text like “header 1”, “header 2”, and so on.

## Step 7: Add Data Rows

Finally, we can add some data to the table. This loop dynamically creates rows and fills the cells with content:

```csharp
for (int RowCounter = 0; RowCounter <= 5; RowCounter++)
{
    Aspose.Pdf.Row row1 = mytable.Rows.Add();
    row1.Cells.Add("col " + RowCounter.ToString() + ", 1");
    row1.Cells.Add("col " + RowCounter.ToString() + ", 2");
    row1.Cells.Add("col " + RowCounter.ToString() + ", 3");
    row1.Cells.Add("col " + RowCounter.ToString() + ", 4");
    row1.Cells.Add("col " + RowCounter.ToString() + ", 5");
    row1.Cells.Add("col " + RowCounter.ToString() + ", 6");
    row1.Cells.Add("col " + RowCounter.ToString() + ", 7");
    row1.Cells.Add("col " + RowCounter.ToString() + ", 11");
    row1.Cells.Add("col " + RowCounter.ToString() + ", 12");
    row1.Cells.Add("col " + RowCounter.ToString() + ", 13");
    row1.Cells.Add("col " + RowCounter.ToString() + ", 14");
    row1.Cells.Add("col " + RowCounter.ToString() + ", 15");
    row1.Cells.Add("col " + RowCounter.ToString() + ", 16");
    row1.Cells.Add("col " + RowCounter.ToString() + ", 17");
}
```

The loop iterates six times, adding rows and filling each cell with corresponding column data (e.g., “col 1, 1”, “col 2, 2”, etc.).

## Step 8: Save the Document

Once all the rows and columns have been added, the last step is to save the document to the specified file path.

```csharp
doc.Save(outFile);
```

Your document is now saved with repeating columns!
