It is often important to know if a PDF document is password protected before processing it. With Aspose.PDF for .NET, you can easily check if a PDF document is protected using the following source code:

## Step 1: Import required libraries

Before you begin, you need to import the necessary libraries for your C# project. Here are the necessary import directives:

```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf;
```

## Step 2: Set path to documents folder

In this step, you need to specify the path to the folder containing the PDF file you want to check. Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY"` in the following code with the actual path to your documents folder:

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 3: Load source PDF document

Now we will load the source PDF document and check if it is password protected using the following code:

```csharp
PdfFileInfo fileInfo = new PdfFileInfo(dataDir + @"IsPasswordProtected.pdf");
```

## Step 4: Check if the PDF is protected

In this step, we will determine if the PDF document is password protected using the `IsEncrypted` method of the `PdfFileInfo` object. Here is the corresponding code:

```csharp
bool encrypted = fileInfo.IsEncrypted;
```

## Step 5: View Encryption Status

Finally, we can display the current encryption status of the PDF using the `Console.WriteLine` method. Here is the corresponding code:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(encrypted.ToString());
```

The displayed message will indicate whether the PDF document is password protected or not.

### Sample source code for Is Password Protected using Aspose.PDF for .NET 
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";
// Load the source PDF doucment
PdfFileInfo fileInfo = new PdfFileInfo(dataDir+ @"IsPasswordProtected.pdf");
// Determine that source PDF file is Encrypted with password
bool encrypted = fileInfo.IsEncrypted;
// MessageBox displays the current status related to PDf encryption
Console.WriteLine(encrypted.ToString());
```
