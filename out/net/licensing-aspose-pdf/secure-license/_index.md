In this tutorial, we will provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to secure a license using Aspose.PDF for .NET. Aspose.PDF is a powerful library that allows you to create, manipulate and convert PDF documents programmatically. By securing your license, you can protect your application and features from unauthorized access.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Visual Studio installed with .NET framework.
2. The Aspose.PDF library for .NET.

## Step 1: Project Setup

To get started, create a new project in Visual Studio and add a reference to the Aspose.PDF for .NET library. You can download the library from Aspose official website and install it on your machine.

## Step 2: Import the necessary namespaces

In your C# code file, import the namespaces required to access the classes and methods provided by Aspose.PDF:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Ionic.Zip;
```

## Step 3: Loading the secure license file

Use the following lines of code to load the secure license file:

```csharp
using (Stream zip = new SecureLicense().GetType().Assembly.GetManifestResourceStream("Aspose.Total.lic.zip"))
{
using (ZipFile zf = ZipFile.Read(zip))
{
MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream();
ZipEntry e = zf["Aspose.Total.lic"];
e.ExtractWithPassword(ms, "test");
ms.Position = 0;
// Use the 'ms' stream containing the secure license
}
}
```
Be sure to replace `"Aspose.Total.lic.zip"` with the actual name of your secure license file and `"test"` with the correct password.
