In this step-by-step guide, we'll walk you through the process of setting custom tag names for PDF documents using Java with Aspose.PDF for Java. Custom tag names help improve the accessibility of your PDF documents, making them more user-friendly for individuals with disabilities.

## Introduction

PDF documents often contain complex content, such as tables, images, and text. To ensure that these documents are accessible to all users, it's essential to use proper tagging. Custom tag names allow you to define meaningful and descriptive names for elements within your PDF, making it easier for screen readers and other assistive technologies to interpret the content.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Aspose.PDF for Java library downloaded and set up.

## Step 1: Create a PDF Document

First, we need to create a PDF document that we'll work with. You can use the following code to create a simple PDF document using Aspose.PDF for Java:

```java
// Import the necessary classes
import com.aspose.pdf.*;

// Create a new PDF document
Document pdfDocument = new Document();
```

## Step 2: Add Content to the PDF

Now, let's add some content to our PDF document. For this example, we'll add a heading and a paragraph:

```java
// Create a page in the PDF
Page page = pdfDocument.getPages().add();

// Add a heading
TextFragment heading = new TextFragment("Custom Tag Names in PDF");
page.getParagraphs().add(heading);

// Add a paragraph
TextFragment paragraph = new TextFragment("Learn how to set custom tag names for PDF documents.");
page.getParagraphs().add(paragraph);
```

## Step 3: Define Custom Tag Names

To set custom tag names, you'll need to use the `Tagged` feature provided by Aspose.PDF. Here's how you can define custom tag names for the elements we added:

```java
// Enable the Tagged feature
pdfDocument.setTagged(true);

// Create a structure element for the heading
StructureElement headingElement = new StructureElement(StandardStructureTypes.H1);
headingElement.setParentElement(pdfDocument.getStructureRoot());
heading.setTag("CustomHeadingTag"); // Define the custom tag name
heading.setTagLanguage("en-US");
headingElement.appendChild(new StructureText(heading));

// Create a structure element for the paragraph
StructureElement paragraphElement = new StructureElement(StandardStructureTypes.P);
paragraphElement.setParentElement(pdfDocument.getStructureRoot());
paragraph.setTag("CustomParagraphTag"); // Define the custom tag name
paragraph.setTagLanguage("en-US");
paragraphElement.appendChild(new StructureText(paragraph));
```

## Step 4: Save the PDF Document

Finally, let's save the PDF document with custom tag names:

```java
pdfDocument.save("CustomTagNames.pdf");
```
