## Introduction to Adding Different Headers in One PDF File using Java

In the realm of document processing in Java, Aspose.PDF stands as a powerful ally. It empowers developers to manipulate PDF files with ease and efficiency. One common requirement is adding different headers to various pages within a single PDF file. In this step-by-step guide, we will delve into accomplishing this task using Aspose.PDF for Java. 

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on this journey, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Aspose.PDF for Java Library: Download and install it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/java/).

Now, let's dive into the nitty-gritty of adding different headers to a PDF file step by step.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Project

To begin, create a Java project in your preferred IDE and add the Aspose.PDF for Java library to your project's classpath.

## Step 2: Import Necessary Packages

Import the required packages from the Aspose.PDF library at the top of your Java file:

```java
import com.aspose.pdf.Document;
import com.aspose.pdf.Page;
import com.aspose.pdf.HeaderFooter;
```

## Step 3: Create a PDF Document

Initialize a new PDF document:

```java
Document pdfDocument = new Document();
```

## Step 4: Add Pages to the PDF

Add the necessary pages to your PDF document. For each page, you can define different headers as needed. Here's an example of adding three pages:

```java
Page page1 = pdfDocument.getPages().add();
Page page2 = pdfDocument.getPages().add();
Page page3 = pdfDocument.getPages().add();
```

## Step 5: Define Headers for Each Page

Now, let's define different headers for each page. You can customize the headers according to your requirements. Below is an example of adding headers to each page:

```java
// Header for Page 1
HeaderFooter header1 = new HeaderFooter();
header1.getParagraphs().add(new TextFragment("Header for Page 1"));

// Header for Page 2
HeaderFooter header2 = new HeaderFooter();
header2.getParagraphs().add(new TextFragment("Header for Page 2"));

// Header for Page 3
HeaderFooter header3 = new HeaderFooter();
header3.getParagraphs().add(new TextFragment("Header for Page 3"));

// Assign headers to respective pages
page1.setHeader(header1);
page2.setHeader(header2);
page3.setHeader(header3);
```

## Step 6: Save the PDF Document

Finally, save your PDF document:

```java
pdfDocument.save("output.pdf");
```

Congratulations! You've successfully added different headers to a single PDF file using Aspose.PDF for Java.
