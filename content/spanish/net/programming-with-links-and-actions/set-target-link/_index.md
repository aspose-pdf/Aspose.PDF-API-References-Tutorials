Learn how to set a target link in PDF file using Aspose.PDF for .NET with this step-by-step guide.

## Step 1: Setting up the environment

Make sure you have set up your development environment with a C# project and the appropriate Aspose.PDF references.

## Step 2: Loading the PDF file

Set the directory path of your documents and upload the PDF file using the following code:

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";
// Load the PDF file
Document document = new Document(dataDir + "UpdateLinks.pdf");
```

## Step 3: Editing the target link

Get the link annotation to modify using the following code:

```csharp
LinkAnnotation linkAnnot = (LinkAnnotation)document.Pages[1].Annotations[1];
GoToRemoteAction goToR = (GoToRemoteAction)linkAnnot.Action;
```

You can adjust the `[1]` indices to select a specific page or annotation.

Next, update the destination without updating the file:

```csharp
goToR.Destination = new XYZExplicitDestination(2, 0, 0, 1.5);
```

And if you also want to update the file:

```csharp
goToR.File = new FileSpecification(dataDir + "input.pdf");
```

## Step 4: Save the document with the updated link

Save the document with the updated link using the `Save` method:

```csharp
dataDir = dataDir + "SetTargetLink_out.pdf";
document. Save(dataDir);
```

## Step 5: Displaying the result

Display a message indicating that the target link was successfully configured and specify the location of the saved file:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nConfiguration of target link successful.\nFile saved at location: " + dataDir);
```
