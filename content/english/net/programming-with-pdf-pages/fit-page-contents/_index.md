## Introduction

When you're working with PDF documents, one challenge that often arises is fitting the contents correctly onto the page. Have you ever faced issues where your text or images get cut off, or maybe they're just not displayed the way you envisioned? Fear not! With Aspose.PDF for .NET, you can easily adjust your PDF pages to ensure all contents fit perfectly. In this guide, you'll learn how to alter PDF dimensions and fit the content beautifully.

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the nitty-gritty of coding with Aspose.PDF for .NET, let's cover a few prerequisites to ensure you have everything you need to get started:

1. Familiarity with C#: This tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of C# programming. If you're a novice, it might help to brush up on the basics first.
2. Aspose.PDF for .NET Library: Make sure you have the Aspose.PDF library installed in your .NET environment. If you haven't done this yet, check [this download link](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/net/) to get the latest version.
3. Development Environment: It’s best to have an IDE like Visual Studio set up to write and execute your code efficiently.
4. Sample PDF File: For the sake of this tutorial, ensure you have a sample PDF file named `input.pdf` that you can manipulate.

## Import Packages

Once you've got everything set up, the first thing to do is to import the necessary packages into your C# project. That way, the compiler recognizes all the types and methods you plan to use.

### Add References

Add a reference to the Aspose.PDF for .NET library in your project. You can do this through the NuGet Package Manager or by downloading the library manually and adding it.

Here’s a quick way to include it in the NuGet Package Manager Console:

```bash
Install-Package Aspose.PDF
```

### Import Namespaces

Start your C# file by importing the required namespaces that will help you interact with the Aspose.PDF library effectively.

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Pdf;
```

Now, let's get our hands dirty! Below, you'll find a step-by-step breakdown of how to fit page contents into your PDF files using Aspose.PDF.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Directory

First, you'll want to set the path to the directory where your PDF document is stored. This helps the program locate the file you want to manipulate.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 2: Load Your PDF Document

Next, load the PDF document into a `Document` object. This allows you to interact with the contents of the file.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "input.pdf");
```

## Step 3: Iterate Through Each Page

PDF files can contain multiple pages. Here, we’ll loop through each page to adjust its dimensions according to the content it holds.

```csharp
foreach (Page page in doc.Pages)
{
```

## Step 4: Get the Media Box

For each page, retrieve its `MediaBox` property. This provides the dimensions of the page where the content is displayed.

```csharp
    Rectangle r = page.MediaBox;
```

## Step 5: Calculate New Width

Now, based on the current orientation, calculate the new width for the page. For our example, we’re expanding the width proportionally. This trick ensures that our contents will always look their best.

```csharp
    // New height is the same
    double newHeight = r.Height;
    // New width is expanded proportionally to make orientation landscape
    double newWidth = r.Height * r.Height / r.Width;
```

## Step 6: Resize the Page

At this point, apply the new dimension to the page. This modifies the MediaBox to fit the newly calculated width and retain the original height.

```csharp
    page.MediaBox = new Rectangle(0, 0, newWidth, newHeight);
}
```

## Step 7: Save Your Changes

Finally, after adjusting all the pages, save your changes to create the new PDF file. You can give it a new name to differentiate it from the original document.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "output_fitted.pdf");
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've just learned how to fit page contents into a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for .NET. With this skill, you can ensure that all the elements in your PDFs are displayed correctly without any awkward cuts or missing information. Isn't it great to have that level of control?
