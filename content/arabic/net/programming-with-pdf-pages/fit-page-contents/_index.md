In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the step-by-step process to adjust page contents in PDF file using Aspose.PDF for .NET. We'll explain the bundled C# source code and provide you with a comprehensive guide to help you understand and implement this feature in your own projects. At the end of this tutorial, you will know how to adjust the content of PDF pages using Aspose.PDF for .NET.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A basic knowledge of the C# programming language
- Aspose.PDF for .NET installed in your development environment

## Step 1: Define the document directory
First, you need to set the path to your documents directory. This is the location where your input PDF file is located. Replace "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY" with the appropriate path.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 2: Load the PDF document
Then you can load the PDF document using the `Document` class of Aspose.PDF. Be sure to specify the correct path to the input PDF file.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "input.pdf");
```

## Step 3: Adjust page content
Now you can cycle through all the pages of the document and adjust the content of each page according to the size of the media box. In the example provided, we adjust the width of the page to render it in landscape mode (landscape) keeping the same height. The new width is calculated based on the aspect ratio of the media box.

```csharp
foreach(Page page in doc.Pages)
{
     Rectangle r = page.MediaBox;
     double newHeight = r.Height;
     double newWidth = r.Height * r.Height / r.Width;
}
```

### Sample source code for Fit Page Contents using Aspose.PDF for .NET 

```csharp

// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "input.pdf");
foreach (Page page in doc.Pages)
{
	Rectangle r = page.MediaBox;
	// New height the same
	double newHeight = r.Height;
	// New width is expanded proportionally to make orientation landscape
	// (we assume that previous orientation is portrait)
	double newWidth = r.Height * r.Height / r.Width;
}          

```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we learned how to adjust PDF page content using Aspose.PDF for .NET. By following the steps outlined above, you can easily implement this functionality in your own projects. Feel free to explore the Aspose.PDF documentation further to discover other useful features for working with PDF files.

### FAQ's for fit page contents in PDF file

#### Q: What does the "media box" represent in the context of PDF pages?

A: In the context of PDF pages, the "media box" represents the bounding box that defines the physical dimensions of the page content. It defines the width, height, and location of the page content within the PDF document.

#### Q: How does the provided C# source code adjust the page content?

A: The provided C# source code adjusts the page content by resizing each page's width to make it appear in landscape mode while keeping the same height. The new width is calculated based on the aspect ratio of the media box, ensuring that the content retains its original proportions.

#### Q: Can I adjust the page content to fit a specific size or aspect ratio?

A: Yes, you can adjust the page content to fit a specific size or aspect ratio by modifying the calculation in the provided C# source code. For example, if you want to fit the page content into a fixed size (e.g., 8.5 x 11 inches), you can calculate the new width and height accordingly.

#### Q: What will happen to the content on the page after adjusting the page size?

A: After adjusting the page size using the provided C# source code, the content on the page will be resized proportionally. If the original content's aspect ratio differs significantly from the new aspect ratio, the content may appear stretched or compressed.

#### Q: Can I adjust the content of specific pages instead of all pages in the PDF document?

A: Yes, you can adjust the content of specific pages instead of all pages in the PDF document. In the provided C# source code, the "foreach" loop iterates through all pages in the document. To adjust the content of specific pages, you can use conditional statements within the loop to target only the desired pages.
