pdfDocument.getPages().get_Item(1).getParagraphs().add(htmlFragment);
```

You can also apply styles to the HTML ordered list to customize its appearance in the PDF document. For example, you can change the font size, color, and alignment.

```java
// Customize the style of the HTML fragment
htmlFragment.getTextState().setFontSize(12);
htmlFragment.getTextState().setFont(Color.BLUE);
htmlFragment.setHorizontalAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Left);
```
