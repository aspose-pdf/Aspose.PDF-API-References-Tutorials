## Introduction

Have you ever found yourself wrestling with a PDF document, wishing it had page numbers for easier navigation? Whether you're a student sharing notes, a professional presenting reports, or anyone managing multi-page documents, adding page numbers can really enhance the clarity of your PDF files. Fortunately, with the powerful Aspose.PDF for .NET library, you can add page number stamps to your PDF documents with ease. In this guide, we’ll walk you through the entire process step-by-step, ensuring that you’re equipped with all the knowledge you need. Let's dive in!

## Prerequisites

Before we get started with adding page number stamps to your PDF documents, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Visual Studio: Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your system. You'll be writing and executing your code here.
2. .NET Framework: Familiarity with C# programming and the .NET framework is essential since Aspose.PDF is designed for .NET applications.
3. Aspose.PDF Library: You can download the Aspose.PDF library from the [Aspose PDF Releases](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/net/). 
4. Basic understanding of PDFs: While you don’t need to be an expert, a basic understanding of how PDF files work will help you comprehend the tutorial better.

Once you have these prerequisites set up, you’ll be ready to start stamping those page numbers!

## Import Packages

Before diving into coding, you need to ensure the necessary Aspose.PDF packages are imported into your project. This is crucial for leveraging the library functions seamlessly. Here’s how to do it:

### Create a New Project

1. Open Visual Studio.
2. Click on `File` > `New` > `Project`.
3. Select a template suited for C# (e.g., Console Application), name it, and click `Create`.

### Add Aspose.PDF Reference

1. Right-click on the project name in the Solution Explorer.
2. Click on `Manage NuGet Packages`.
3. Search for `Aspose.PDF` and install the latest version.

```csharp
using System.IO;
using System;
using Aspose.Pdf;
using Aspose.Pdf.Text;
```

With the library ready to roll, let's jump into the coding!

Now that our environment is set up, it's time to add page number stamps to a PDF file. We will break this process down into clear steps for better comprehension.

## Step 1: Specify the Document Directory

To begin, you need to specify the directory where your PDF file is located. This is the starting point of your project.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"; // Update this path
```

Explanation: Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the path leading to the directory containing your PDF file. This is critical as it tells your code where to find the file you want to manipulate.

## Step 2: Open the Document

Next, we’ll open the existing PDF document to which we want to add the page number stamps.

```csharp
Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "PageNumberStamp.pdf");
```

Explanation: Here, we're using the `Document` class provided by Aspose.PDF to open our specific PDF file. Ensure the file name matches the actual file you have in your directory.

## Step 3: Create a Page Number Stamp

Now comes the fun part! Let’s create a page number stamp to add to our PDF.

```csharp
PageNumberStamp pageNumberStamp = new PageNumberStamp();
```

Explanation: The `PageNumberStamp` class will allow us to create a stamp that will display the current page number with respect to the total number of pages in the document.

## Step 4: Configure the Stamp

Now, you’ll need to configure your stamp settings. This is where you design how the stamp looks and behaves.

```csharp
pageNumberStamp.Background = false;
pageNumberStamp.Format = "Page # of " + pdfDocument.Pages.Count;
pageNumberStamp.BottomMargin = 10;
pageNumberStamp.HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Center;
pageNumberStamp.StartingNumber = 1;
```

Explanation:
- `Background = false`: This means the stamp will appear in the foreground.
- `Format`: Here, you're setting the format to show "Page X of Y", where you dynamically fetch the total pages in the document.
- `BottomMargin`: Adjusts the distance from the bottom of the page.
- `HorizontalAlignment`: Centers the stamp horizontally.
- `StartingNumber`: Sets what the starting page number will be, typically from 1.

## Step 5: Set Text Properties

Next, you can customize how the text in the stamp looks.

```csharp
pageNumberStamp.TextState.Font = FontRepository.FindFont("Arial");
pageNumberStamp.TextState.FontSize = 14.0F;
pageNumberStamp.TextState.FontStyle = FontStyles.Bold;
pageNumberStamp.TextState.FontStyle = FontStyles.Italic;
pageNumberStamp.TextState.ForegroundColor = Color.Aqua;
```

Explanation: These attributes configure the font type, font size, style (both bold and italic), and color of the text within the stamp to make it visually appealing.

## Step 6: Add the Stamp to a Specific Page

With your stamp configured, it’s time to add it to a specific page in your document.

```csharp
pdfDocument.Pages[1].AddStamp(pageNumberStamp);
```

Explanation: This line adds the stamp to the first page of the PDF. You can adjust the `Pages[1]` index for other pages as necessary.

## Step 7: Save the Output Document

Finally, save the modified PDF document so your changes are permanent.

```csharp
dataDir = dataDir + "PageNumberStamp_out.pdf";
pdfDocument.Save(dataDir);
Console.WriteLine("\nPage number stamp added successfully.\nFile saved at " + dataDir);
```

Explanation: You’re defining the output file path and saving the document. The console will let you know that the stamp was added successfully and where the file is saved.
