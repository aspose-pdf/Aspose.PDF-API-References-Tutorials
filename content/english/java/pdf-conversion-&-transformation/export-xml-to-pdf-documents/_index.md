## Export XML to PDF Documents using Aspose.PDF for Java

In today's digital age, efficient document handling is crucial. Many businesses rely on XML files to store and exchange data. Converting XML files to PDF documents can streamline data representation and sharing. In this article, we will explore how to achieve this using Aspose.PDF for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have JDK installed on your system.
- Aspose.PDF for Java: Download and install Aspose.PDF for Java from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/java/).

## Setting up your Project

Let's start by setting up a new Java project. You can use your favorite Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or simply create a project using command-line tools. 

## Adding Aspose.PDF to your Project

To begin using Aspose.PDF for Java, you need to add the Aspose.PDF library to your project. You can download the library from the website and add it as a dependency in your project.

```java
// Add Aspose.PDF as a dependency
import com.aspose.pdf.*;
```

## Converting XML to PDF

Now that we have our project set up and Aspose.PDF added, let's dive into the code for converting XML to PDF.

```java
// Load XML data
Document doc = new Document();
Page page = doc.getPages().add();

TextFragment textFragment = new TextFragment("Your XML Data Here");
page.getParagraphs().add(textFragment);

// Save as PDF
doc.save("output.pdf");
```

In this code snippet, we first create a new `Document` object and add a page to it. We then create a `TextFragment` containing your XML data and add it to the page. Finally, we save the document as a PDF file named "output.pdf."

## Customizing the Conversion

You can customize the PDF conversion to meet your specific requirements. For example, you can set page size, margins, fonts, and much more. Aspose.PDF for Java provides extensive documentation to help you tailor the conversion process according to your needs. You can find the documentation [here](https://reference.aspose.com/pdf/java/).
