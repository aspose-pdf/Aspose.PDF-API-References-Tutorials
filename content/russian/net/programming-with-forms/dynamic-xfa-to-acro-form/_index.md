In this tutorial, we will show you how to convert an XFA To dynamic form to an AcroForm using Aspose.PDF for .NET. We will explain the C# source code step by step to guide you through this process.

## Step 1: Preparation

First, make sure you have imported the necessary libraries and set the path to the documents directory:

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 2: Load the dynamic XFA form

Load the dynamic XFA form:

```csharp
Document document = new Document(dataDir + "DynamicXFAToAcroForm.pdf");
```

## Step 3: Set Form Type as Standard AcroForm

Set the form type as standard AcroForm:

```csharp
document.Form.Type = FormType.Standard;
```

## Step 4: Save the Resulting PDF

Save the resulting PDF:

```csharp
dataDir = dataDir + "Standard_AcroForm_out.pdf";
document. Save(dataDir);
```

### Sample source code for Dynamic XFA To Acro Form using Aspose.PDF for .NET 
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
// Load dynamic XFA form
Document document = new Document(dataDir + "DynamicXFAToAcroForm.pdf");
// Set the form fields type as standard AcroForm
document.Form.Type = FormType.Standard;
dataDir = dataDir + "Standard_AcroForm_out.pdf";
// Save the resultant PDF
document.Save(dataDir);
Console.WriteLine("\nDynamic XFA form converted to standard AcroForm successfully.\nFile saved at " + dataDir);
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to convert an XFA To dynamic form to a standard AcroForm form using Aspose.PDF for .NET. By following these steps, you can easily convert your dynamic XFATo forms to AcroForms for more common use.

### FAQ's

#### Q: What is the difference between a dynamic XFA form and a standard AcroForm?

A: A dynamic XFA (XML Forms Architecture) form is a type of PDF form that uses XML-based data to define its layout and behavior. XFA forms are often used in interactive and data-intensive forms. On the other hand, a standard AcroForm is a more traditional type of PDF form that uses the PDF format itself to define its structure and appearance. AcroForms are widely supported by PDF viewers and can be more compatible with various applications.

#### Q: Why would I want to convert a dynamic XFA form to a standard AcroForm?

A: Converting a dynamic XFA form to a standard AcroForm can be useful in scenarios where XFA forms are not fully supported or when you want to achieve greater compatibility with different PDF viewers and applications. Standard AcroForms are generally more widely supported across different platforms and devices.

#### Q: Can I modify the form fields after converting a dynamic XFA form to a standard AcroForm?

A: Yes, after converting a dynamic XFA form to a standard AcroForm, you can modify the form fields as needed using Aspose.PDF for .NET. You can add new fields, change their properties, set field values, and perform other form-related operations.

#### Q: Are there any limitations or considerations when converting dynamic XFA forms to standard AcroForms?

A: Yes, there are some limitations to consider when converting dynamic XFA forms to standard AcroForms. XFA forms can have complex and dynamic layouts, including features such as dynamic tables, repeating sections, and form calculations, which may not be fully preserved in the conversion process. Additionally, some specific form field properties unique to XFA forms may not be applicable in AcroForms.

#### Q: Can I convert a standard AcroForm to a dynamic XFA form using Aspose.PDF for .NET?

A: Aspose.PDF for .NET currently supports converting dynamic XFA forms to standard AcroForms, but it does not support the reverse operation of converting standard AcroForms to dynamic XFA forms. Converting standard AcroForms to dynamic XFA forms involves more complex transformations and may not be fully supported in all scenarios.
