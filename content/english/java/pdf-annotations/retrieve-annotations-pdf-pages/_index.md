### Step 4: Access PDF Pages
Access the pages of the PDF document:
```java
Page page = pdfDocument.getPages().get_Item(1); // Replace with the desired page number.
```

### Step 5: Retrieve Annotations
To retrieve annotations from the page, you can use a loop and filter annotations of your interest, such as text annotations:
```java
for (com.aspose.pdf.Annotation annotation : page.getAnnotations()) {
    if (annotation instanceof TextAnnotation) {
        TextAnnotation textAnnotation = (TextAnnotation) annotation;
        System.out.println("Text: " + textAnnotation.getTitle());
        System.out.println("Contents: " + textAnnotation.getContents());
    }
}
```

### Step 6: Run the Code

Compile and run your Java code to retrieve annotations from the PDF page. You can customize this code to meet your specific requirements, such as saving the retrieved annotations to a file or performing further analysis.
