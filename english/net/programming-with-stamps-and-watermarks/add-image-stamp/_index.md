In this tutorial, we will take you step by step on how to add an image buffer to a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for .NET. We'll show you how to use the provided C# source code to add a custom image buffer to a specific page in the PDF document.

## Step 1: Setting up the environment

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- An installed .NET development environment.
- The Aspose.PDF library for .NET downloaded and referenced in your project.

## Step 2: Loading the PDF document

The first step is to load the existing PDF document into your project. Here's how:

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";

// Open the document
Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "AddImageStamp.pdf");
```

Be sure to replace "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY" with the actual path to the directory where your PDF document is located.

## Step 3: Creating the framebuffer

Now that you have uploaded the PDF document, you can create the image stamp to add. Here's how to do it:

```csharp
// Create the frame buffer
ImageStamp imageStamp = new ImageStamp(dataDir + "aspose-logo.jpg");
```

The code above creates a new image buffer using the "aspose-logo.jpg" file. Make sure the image file path is correct.

## Step 4: Configuring Image Buffer Properties

Before adding the image stamp to the PDF document, you can configure various properties of the stamp, such as opacity, size, position, etc. Here's how:

```csharp
// Configure image buffer properties
imageStamp. Background = true;
imageStamp. XIndent = 100;
imageStamp. YIndent = 100;
imageStamp. Height = 300;
imageStamp. Width = 300;
imageStamp.Rotate = Rotate.on270;
imageStamp. Opacity = 0.5;
```

You can adjust these properties according to your needs.

## Step 5: Adding the image stamp to the PDF

Now that the image stamp is ready, you can add it to a specific page of the PDF document. Here's how:

```csharp
// Add the frame buffer to the specific page
pdfDocument.Pages[1].AddStamp(imageStamp);
```

The code above adds the image buffer to the first page of the PDF document. You can specify another page if needed.

## Step 6: Save the output document

Once you have added the image buffer, you can save the modified PDF document. Here's how:

```csharp
// Save the output document
pdfDocument.Save(dataDir);
```

The above code saves the edited PDF document to the specified directory.

### Sample source code for Add Image Stamp using Aspose.PDF for .NET 
```csharp

// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

// Open document
Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir+ "AddImageStamp.pdf");

// Create image stamp
ImageStamp imageStamp = new ImageStamp(dataDir + "aspose-logo.jpg");
imageStamp.Background = true;
imageStamp.XIndent = 100;
imageStamp.YIndent = 100;
imageStamp.Height = 300;
imageStamp.Width = 300;
imageStamp.Rotate = Rotation.on270;
imageStamp.Opacity = 0.5;

// Add stamp to particular page
pdfDocument.Pages[1].AddStamp(imageStamp);
dataDir = dataDir + "AddImageStamp_out.pdf";

// Save output document
pdfDocument.Save(dataDir);
Console.WriteLine("\nImage stamp added successfully.\nFile saved at " + dataDir);
```

## Conclusion

Congratulation ! You have learned how to add an image buffer using Aspose.PDF for .NET. Now you can apply this knowledge to your own projects to add custom image stamps to PDF documents.
