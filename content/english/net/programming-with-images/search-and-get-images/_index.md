## Introduction

Are you looking for a straightforward way to extract images from PDF files using Aspose.PDF for .NET? You’ve come to the right place! In this article, we'll dive into the specifics of how to effectively search for and retrieve images embedded in a PDF document. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just dipping your toes into the world of PDF manipulation, this guide will walk you through the entire process step by step.

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the nitty-gritty of code, there are a few prerequisites you need to check off your list. 

### .NET Framework

Ensure you have the .NET Framework installed on your machine. Aspose.PDF for .NET is compatible with various versions, but it’s best to use the latest stable release to enjoy all the latest features and improvements.

### Aspose.PDF Library

You’ll need access to the Aspose.PDF library. If you haven’t yet, you can download it from this link: [Download Aspose.PDF for .NET](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/net/). Additionally, you can explore their [one-month free trial](https://releases.aspose.com/) to kickstart your projects without any cost.

### Development Environment

A suitable development environment like Visual Studio or any IDE of your preference should be set up to write and run the code seamlessly.

## Import Packages

To work with Aspose.PDF for .NET, you will first need to import the appropriate namespaces into your project. Here’s what you need to do:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Pdf;
using System;
```

Each of these packages serves specific purposes when manipulating PDF documents. The `Aspose.Pdf` namespace is the cornerstone of your operations, while the other two help deal with images and text within the PDF.

## Step 1: Set Your Document Path

Before anything else, you need to define the path where your PDF file is located. This piece of code sets that up:

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

Replace "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY" with the actual path to the directory containing your PDF file, for example, `C:\Documents\`.

## Step 2: Open the PDF Document

Next, you’ll want to load the PDF document into your application. This is done by creating a new `Document` instance with the file path you just specified:

```csharp
Aspose.Pdf.Document doc = new Aspose.Pdf.Document(dataDir + "SearchAndGetImages.pdf");
```

## Step 3: Create the ImagePlacementAbsorber

To search for images within a PDF, you need an `ImagePlacementAbsorber` object. This class helps in absorbing images from the PDF during the extraction process:

```csharp
ImagePlacementAbsorber abs = new ImagePlacementAbsorber();
```

## Step 4: Accept the Absorber for All Pages

This step is crucial as it tells the `Document` to apply the image absorber across all the pages. It ensures that any images placed anywhere within the document will be identified:

```csharp
doc.Pages.Accept(abs);
```

## Step 5: Loop Through Image Placements

Now that you’ve absorbed the images, it’s time to delve into them. You’ll loop through each image placement extracted from the PDF:

```csharp
foreach (ImagePlacement imagePlacement in abs.ImagePlacements)
{
    // Further steps to get image properties
}
```

## Step 6: Extract Image Properties

Inside the loop, you can start retrieving valuable properties about each image. Using the `imagePlacement` object, you can access dimensions and resolution:

```csharp
XImage image = imagePlacement.Image; // Get the image

Console.Out.WriteLine("image width:" + imagePlacement.Rectangle.Width);
Console.Out.WriteLine("image height:" + imagePlacement.Rectangle.Height);
Console.Out.WriteLine("image LLX:" + imagePlacement.Rectangle.LLX);
Console.Out.WriteLine("image LLY:" + imagePlacement.Rectangle.LLY);
Console.Out.WriteLine("image horizontal resolution:" + imagePlacement.Resolution.X);
Console.Out.WriteLine("image vertical resolution:" + imagePlacement.Resolution.Y);
```

## Conclusion

And there you have it! By following these steps, you can efficiently search for and retrieve images from PDF files using Aspose.PDF for .NET. With just a few lines of code, you can extract valuable images and their properties, opening doors to many possibilities in your application.
