## Introduction

In the digital age, managing PDF documents efficiently is crucial for both personal and professional use. Whether you're a developer looking to enhance your application or a business professional needing to organize your documents, understanding how to manipulate PDFs can save you time and effort. One of the essential features of PDF management is the ability to extract bookmarks and their corresponding page numbers. In this tutorial, we will explore how to achieve this using Aspose.PDF for .NET, a powerful library that simplifies PDF manipulation.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the code, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Visual Studio: Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your machine. This will be your development environment.
2. Aspose.PDF for .NET: You need to have the Aspose.PDF library. You can download it from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will help you understand the code snippets better.

## Import Packages

To get started, you need to import the necessary packages in your C# project. Here’s how you can do it:

1. Open your Visual Studio project.
2. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer and select "Manage NuGet Packages."
3. Search for `Aspose.PDF` and install the latest version.

Now that you have everything set up, let’s break down the process of extracting bookmark page numbers step by step.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Document Directory

Before you can extract bookmarks, you need to specify the path to your PDF document. This is where your PDF file is located.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

In this step, replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path where your PDF file is stored. This path is crucial as it tells the program where to look for the PDF file you want to work with.

## Step 2: Create a PdfBookmarkEditor Instance

Next, you need to create an instance of the `PdfBookmarkEditor` class. This class provides methods to manipulate bookmarks in PDF files.

```csharp
// Create PdfBookmarkEditor
PdfBookmarkEditor bookmarkEditor = new PdfBookmarkEditor();
```

Here, we are instantiating the `PdfBookmarkEditor`. This object will allow us to bind our PDF file and extract bookmarks from it.

## Step 3: Open the PDF File

Now, it’s time to bind the PDF file to the `PdfBookmarkEditor` instance you just created.

```csharp
// Open PDF file
bookmarkEditor.BindPdf(dataDir + "GetBookmarks.pdf");
```

In this line, we are using the `BindPdf` method to open the PDF file named `GetBookmarks.pdf`. Make sure this file exists in the specified directory; otherwise, you will encounter an error.

## Step 4: Extract Bookmarks

With the PDF file opened, you can now extract the bookmarks using the `ExtractBookmarks` method.

```csharp
// Extract bookmarks
Aspose.Pdf.Facades.Bookmarks bookmarks = bookmarkEditor.ExtractBookmarks();
```

This step retrieves all the bookmarks from the PDF file and stores them in a variable called `bookmarks`. This variable will hold all the bookmark information that we will process in the next step.

## Step 5: Iterate Through Bookmarks

Now that you have the bookmarks, you can loop through them to display their titles and page numbers.

```csharp
foreach (Aspose.Pdf.Facades.Bookmark bookmark in bookmarks)
{
    string strLevelSeprator = string.Empty;
    for (int i = 1; i < bookmark.Level; i++)
    {
        strLevelSeprator += "----";
    }
    Console.WriteLine("{0}Title: {1}", strLevelSeprator, bookmark.Title);
    Console.WriteLine("{0}Page Number: {1}", strLevelSeprator, bookmark.PageNumber);
    Console.WriteLine("{0}Page Action: {1}", strLevelSeprator, bookmark.Action);
}
```

In this loop, we are iterating through each bookmark. For each bookmark, we create a string separator based on its level (to visually represent the hierarchy of bookmarks). Then, we print the title, page number, and action associated with each bookmark to the console.

## Conclusion

Extracting bookmark page numbers from a PDF file using Aspose.PDF for .NET is a straightforward process. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can efficiently manage bookmarks in your PDF documents. Whether you're developing an application or simply need to organize your PDFs, this knowledge will undoubtedly come in handy.
