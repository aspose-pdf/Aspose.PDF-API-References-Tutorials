## Introduction

In the digital age, PDF documents are a staple for sharing and preserving information. One essential feature of PDFs is bookmarks, which provide a convenient way to navigate through lengthy documents. However, sometimes, the default bookmark view might not be enough to grasp the document's structure efficiently. This article explores how to view expanded bookmarks in PDFs using Aspose.PDF for Java.

## Understanding Bookmarks in PDFs

Before diving into expanded bookmarks, let's understand what bookmarks are in the context of PDFs. Bookmarks, also known as outlines, serve as a table of contents within a PDF document. They provide users with quick links to specific sections, chapters, or pages within the file. Typically, bookmarks appear as a hierarchical list on the left side of the PDF viewer, allowing users to jump to various sections with a single click.

## The Need for Expanded Bookmarks

While standard bookmarks provide a valuable navigation tool, they may fall short when dealing with complex documents. Expanded bookmarks offer a more detailed view, displaying subheadings and sub-subheadings in a document's structure. This feature becomes particularly handy when you're dealing with extensive manuals, reports, or e-books. Aspose.PDF for Java allows us to unlock this extended view, enhancing the user's reading experience.
