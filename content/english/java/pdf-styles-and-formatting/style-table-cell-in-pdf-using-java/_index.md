## Introduction

In the realm of software development, generating and manipulating PDF documents is a common task. Aspose.PDF for Java, a powerful Java API, provides developers with the tools they need to create and modify PDFs effortlessly. In this step-by-step guide, we will explore how to style table cells in a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the code, let's ensure we have everything we need:

- Java Development Environment: Make sure you have Java installed on your system.

- Aspose.PDF for Java Library: Download the library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/java/) if you haven't already.

## Creating a Simple PDF Table

To begin, let's create a simple PDF table. We'll use Aspose.PDF for Java to generate a basic table structure.

```java
// Java code to create a PDF document with a table
Document pdfDocument = new Document();
Page page = pdfDocument.getPages().add();

// Create a table
Table table = new Table();
page.getParagraphs().add(table);

// Add table rows and cells
Row row1 = table.getRows().add();
row1.getCells().add("Name");
row1.getCells().add("Age");

Row row2 = table.getRows().add();
row2.getCells().add("John Doe");
row2.getCells().add("30");

// Save the PDF document
pdfDocument.save("SimpleTable.pdf");
```

This code will create a basic table with two columns: "Name" and "Age."

## Styling Table Cells

Now that we have our basic table, let's move on to styling the table cells. We'll focus on changing the background color of specific cells.

```java
// Java code to style table cells in a PDF
// Load the existing PDF document
Document pdfDocument = new Document("SimpleTable.pdf");

// Access the first page and table
Page page = pdfDocument.getPages().get_Item(1);
Table table = (Table) page.getParagraphs().get_Item(1);

// Access the specific cell you want to style (e.g., "John Doe")
Cell cellToStyle = table.getRows().get_Item(2).getCells().get_Item(1);

// Set the background color of the cell
cellToStyle.setBackgroundColor(Color.getLightGray());

// Save the updated PDF document
pdfDocument.save("StyledTable.pdf");
```

In this code, we load the existing PDF document containing our table and then access the specific cell we want to style. We set the background color of the cell to light gray. Finally, we save the updated PDF document.

## Conclusion

In this article, we've explored how to style table cells in a PDF using Aspose.PDF for Java. With this powerful library, you can take full control of your PDF documents and customize them to your specific needs. Whether you're highlighting data or creating complex reports, Aspose.PDF for Java has you covered.
