## Introduction

In this step-by-step guide, we will explore how to remove tables from an existing PDF document using Java with the help of the Aspose.PDF for Java library. Tables are commonly used in PDF documents to present data, but there may be situations where you need to extract or eliminate them. Whether it's for data analysis or formatting adjustments, we've got you covered. Let's dive in and learn how to achieve this with Aspose.PDF for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Java Project

To begin, create a new Java project or open an existing one where you want to remove tables from a PDF document.

```java
// Iterate through the pages
for (Page page : pdfDocument.getPages()) {
    // Check for tables and remove them
    for (com.aspose.pdf.Table table : page.getTables()) {
        table.delete();
    }
}
```

## Step 5: Save the Modified PDF
