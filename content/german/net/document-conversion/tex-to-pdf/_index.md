## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

## Step 1: Loading the TeX file
The first step is to load the TeX file into a `Document` object using the TeX load option (`LatexLoadOptions`). Use the following code:

```

Be sure to replace `"YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY"` with the actual directory where your TeX file is located.

## Step 2: Convert to PDF
The second step is to convert the TeX document to a PDF document using the `Save` method of the `Document` object. Use the following code:

```csharp
// Save the output in PDF file
doc.Save(dataDir + "TeXToPDF_out.pdf");
```

Be sure to specify the desired path and filename for the resulting PDF file.
