## Introduction to Adding Text Stamp in PDF File using Java

In the world of digital documents, PDF files play a significant role. They are widely used for sharing information and maintaining the integrity of the content. In many cases, it becomes essential to add additional information to a PDF file, such as stamps, watermarks, or annotations. In this article, we will explore how to add a text stamp to a PDF file using Java programming with the help of Aspose.PDF for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the coding part, let's make sure you have everything you need:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.).
- Aspose.PDF for Java library. You can download it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/java/).

## Setting Up Your Java Project

1. Create a new Java project in your preferred IDE.
2. Add the Aspose.PDF for Java library to your project's build path.

## Creating a PDF Document

Let's start by creating a new PDF document using Aspose.PDF for Java.

```java
import com.aspose.pdf.Document;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a new PDF document
        Document pdfDocument = new Document();
        
        // Add a page to the document
        pdfDocument.getPages().add();
        
        // Save the document
        pdfDocument.save("output.pdf");
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we import the necessary classes from the Aspose.PDF library, create a new PDF document, add a page to it, and save it with the name "output.pdf."

## Adding a Text Stamp

Now, let's proceed to add a text stamp to our PDF document. A text stamp can be used to mark the document with important information, such as a draft watermark or a confidential label.

```java
import com.aspose.pdf.*;
import com.aspose.pdf.facades.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a new PDF document
        Document pdfDocument = new Document();
        
        // Add a page to the document
        pdfDocument.getPages().add();
        
        // Create a TextStamp object
        TextStamp textStamp = new TextStamp("Confidential");
        textStamp.getTextState().setFont(FontRepository.findFont("Arial"));
        textStamp.getTextState().setFontSize(18);
        textStamp.getTextState().setForegroundColor(Color.getRed());
        
        // Add the text stamp to the page
        pdfDocument.getPages().get_Item(1).addStamp(textStamp);
        
        // Save the document
        pdfDocument.save("stamped_document.pdf");
    }
}
```

In this code, we first create a `TextStamp` object with the text "Confidential." We customize its font, font size, and foreground color. Then, we add the text stamp to the first page of our PDF document. Finally, we save the document as "stamped_document.pdf."

## Conclusion

In this article, we've learned how to add a text stamp to a PDF file using Java and Aspose.PDF for Java. This can be useful for various purposes, such as labeling documents, marking them as drafts, or adding important annotations. Aspose.PDF for Java provides a powerful and flexible way to manipulate PDF files programmatically, giving you full control over their content.

Now you have the knowledge and tools to enhance your PDF documents with text stamps in Java. Experiment with different text, fonts, and colors to create stamps that meet your specific needs.

## FAQ's

### How do I change the position of the text stamp in the PDF?

To change the position of the text stamp in the PDF, you can set its `XIndent` and `YIndent` properties. These properties determine the horizontal and vertical position of the stamp on the page.

```java
textStamp.setXIndent(100);
textStamp.setYIndent(200);
```

### Can I add custom images as stamps in addition to text?

Yes, you can add custom images as stamps in addition to text using Aspose.PDF for Java. You can create an `ImageStamp` and customize it with your image file.

### Is Aspose.PDF for Java free to use?

Aspose.PDF for Java is a commercial library, and it requires a valid license for usage in a production environment. However, you can try it for free in a trial mode.

### How can I rotate the text stamp in the PDF?

To rotate the text stamp in the PDF, you can use the `setRotate` method of the `TextStamp` class. For example, to rotate the stamp by 45 degrees:

```java
textStamp.setRotation(45);
```

### Where can I find more documentation and examples for Aspose.PDF for Java?
