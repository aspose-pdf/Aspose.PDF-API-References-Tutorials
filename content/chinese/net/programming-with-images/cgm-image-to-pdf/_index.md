```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 2: Define the input and output file

Set the CGM input file name and PDF output file name. Replace `"corvette.cgm"` with the name of your CGM file, and update `dataDir` with the desired output directory and PDF file name.

```csharp
string inputFile = dataDir + "corvette.cgm";
dataDir = dataDir + "CGMImageToPDF_out.pdf";
```

## Step 3: Convert CGM image to PDF

Use the `Produce` method of `PdfProducer` to convert the CGM file to PDF format using `ImportFormat.Cgm`. Specify the CGM input file and the PDF output file.

```csharp
PdfProducer.Produce(inputFile, ImportFormat.Cgm, dataDir);
```
