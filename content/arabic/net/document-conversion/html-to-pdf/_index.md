In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of converting an HTML file to PDF using Aspose.PDF for .NET. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language used to structure and present web content. By following the steps below, you will be able to convert HTML files to PDF format.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge of the C# programming language.
- Aspose.PDF library for .NET installed on your system.
- A development environment such as Visual Studio.

## Step 1: Loading the HTML file
In this step, we will load the HTML file using Aspose.PDF for .NET. Follow the code below:

```csharp
// Path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";

HtmlLoadOptions options = new HtmlLoadOptions();
options.CustomLoaderOfExternalResources = new LoadOptions.ResourceLoadingStrategy(SamePictureLoader);

Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "HTMLToPDF.html", options);
```

Be sure to replace `"YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY"` with the actual directory where your HTML file is located.

## Step 2: HTML loading options
Now that we've loaded the HTML file, we can specify specific loading options. Use the following code:

```csharp
options.CustomLoaderOfExternalResources = new LoadOptions.ResourceLoadingStrategy(SamePictureLoader);
```

The code above tells Aspose.PDF to use a custom loading strategy for external resources, such as images. You can customize this policy to suit your needs.

## Step 3: HTML to PDF conversion
After loading the HTML file and specifying the loading options, we can proceed with the conversion to PDF. Use the following code:

```csharp
pdfDocument.Save("HTMLToPDF_out.pdf");
```

### Example source code for HTML to PDF using Aspose.PDF for .NET

	// The path to the documents directory.
	string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

	HtmlLoadOptions options = new HtmlLoadOptions();
	options.CustomLoaderOfExternalResources = new LoadOptions.ResourceLoadingStrategy(SamePictureLoader);

	Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "HTMLToPDF.html", options);
	pdfDocument.Save("HTMLToPDF_out.pdf");
	
}
