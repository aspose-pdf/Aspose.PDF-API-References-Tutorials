In this detailed tutorial, we will walk you through the provided C# source code step by step to format text structure using Aspose.PDF for .NET. Follow the instructions below to understand how to style and format the text in PDF file.

## Step 1: Setting up the environment

Before you begin, make sure you've configured your development environment to use Aspose.PDF for .NET. This includes installing the Aspose.PDF library and configuring your project to reference it.

## Step 2: Creating the PDF document

In this step, we will create a new PDF document object with Aspose.PDF.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";

// Create the PDF document
Document document = new Document();
```

We have created a new PDF document with Aspose.PDF.

## Step 3: Get content to work with TaggedPdf

In this step, we will get the contents of the PDF document to work with the tagged structure.

```csharp
// Get content to work with TaggedPdf
ITaggedContent taggedContent = document.TaggedContent;
```

We got the contents of the PDF document to work with the tagged structure.

## Step 4: Set document title and language

Now we will set the title and language of the PDF document.

```csharp
// Define the document title and language
taggedContent.SetTitle("Tagged PDF document");
taggedContent.SetLanguage("fr-FR");
```

We have defined the title and the language of the PDF document.

## Step 5: Creating a paragraph element

In this step, we'll create a new paragraph element and add it to the tagged structure.

```csharp
// Create a paragraph element
ParagraphElement p = taggedContent.CreateParagraphElement();
taggedContent.RootElement.AppendChild(p);
```

We created a new paragraph element and added it to the root of the tagged structure.

## Step 6: Formatting the text

Now let's style and format the text of the paragraph element.

```csharp
// Format the text
p.StructureTextState.FontSize = 18F;
p.StructureTextState.ForegroundColor = Color.Red;
p.StructureTextState.FontStyle = FontStyles.Italic;
p.SetText("Text in italic red.");
```

We applied formatting to the text by setting the font size, color, and font style.

## Step 7: Saving the tagged PDF document

Now that we've styled the text in our PDF document, let's save it as a tagged PDF document.

```csharp
// Save the tagged PDF document
document.Save(dataDir + "StyleTextStructure.pdf");
```

We saved the tagged PDF document in the specified directory.

### Sample source code for Style Text Structure using Aspose.PDF for .NET 

```csharp

// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

// Create Pdf Document
Document document = new Document();

// Get Content for work with TaggedPdf
ITaggedContent taggedContent = document.TaggedContent;

// Set Title and Language for Documnet
taggedContent.SetTitle("Tagged Pdf Document");
taggedContent.SetLanguage("en-US");
ParagraphElement p = taggedContent.CreateParagraphElement();
taggedContent.RootElement.AppendChild(p);

// Under Development
p.StructureTextState.FontSize = 18F;
p.StructureTextState.ForegroundColor = Color.Red;
p.StructureTextState.FontStyle = FontStyles.Italic;
p.SetText("Red italic text.");

// Save Tagged Pdf Document
document.Save(dataDir + "StyleTextStructure.pdf");

```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to style and format the text structure in a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for .NET. You can now use Aspose.PDF to create PDF documents with custom formatting for text.
