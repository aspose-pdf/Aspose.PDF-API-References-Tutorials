## Introduction

Have you ever opened a PDF document only to find that the fonts are missing or not displaying correctly? It can be frustrating, right? Well, fear not! In this tutorial, we’re going to dive into how to set a default font in a PDF file using Aspose.PDF for .NET. This powerful library allows you to manipulate PDF documents with ease, and setting a default font is just one of the many features it offers. So, grab your coding hat, and let’s get started!

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the code, there are a few things you’ll need to have in place:

1. Visual Studio: Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your machine. It’s the best IDE for .NET development.
2. Aspose.PDF for .NET: You’ll need to download and install the Aspose.PDF library. You can find it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: A little familiarity with C# programming will go a long way in understanding the examples we’ll cover.

## Import Packages

To get started, you’ll need to import the necessary packages in your C# project. Here’s how you can do it:

1. Open your Visual Studio project.
2. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer and select "Manage NuGet Packages."
3. Search for `Aspose.PDF` and install the latest version.

Once you have the package installed, you’re ready to start coding!

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project

### Create a New Project

First things first, let’s create a new C# project in Visual Studio:

- Open Visual Studio and select "Create a new project."
- Choose "Console App (.NET Core)" and click "Next."
- Name your project (e.g., `AsposePdfExample`) and click "Create."

### Add Using Directives

Now, let’s add the necessary using directives at the top of your `Program.cs` file:

```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf;
using Aspose.Pdf.Text;
using System.IO;
```

These directives will allow you to access the Aspose.PDF classes and methods.

## Step 2: Load the PDF Document

### Specify the Document Path

Next, you’ll need to specify the path to the PDF document you want to work with. Here’s how to do it:

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"; // Replace with your actual directory
string documentName = Path.Combine(dataDir, "input.pdf");
```

Make sure to replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path where your PDF file is located.

### Load the Document

Now, let’s load the existing PDF document:

```csharp
using (FileStream fs = new FileStream(documentName, FileMode.Open))
{
    Document document = new Document(fs);
}
```

This code snippet opens the PDF file and creates a `Document` object that you can manipulate.

## Step 3: Set the Default Font

### Create PdfSaveOptions

Now comes the exciting part! You’ll need to create an instance of `PdfSaveOptions` to specify the default font:

```csharp
PdfSaveOptions pdfSaveOptions = new PdfSaveOptions();
```

### Specify the Default Font Name

Next, you’ll set the default font name. For this example, we’ll use "Arial":

```csharp
pdfSaveOptions.DefaultFontName = "Arial";
```

This line tells Aspose.PDF to use Arial as the default font for any text that doesn’t have a specified font.

## Step 4: Save the Document

Finally, it’s time to save the modified PDF document with the new default font:

```csharp
document.Save(Path.Combine(dataDir, "output_out.pdf"), pdfSaveOptions);
```

This line saves the document as `output_out.pdf` in the specified directory.

## Conclusion

And there you have it! You’ve successfully set a default font in a PDF file using Aspose.PDF for .NET. This simple yet powerful feature can help ensure that your documents look exactly how you want them to, even when fonts are missing. So, the next time you encounter a PDF with font issues, you’ll know exactly what to do!
