## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the nitty-gritty of converting PDFs to XLS, there are a few things you need to have in place:

1. .NET Framework: Ensure you have the .NET Framework installed on your machine. Aspose.PDF for .NET is compatible with various versions, so check the documentation for specifics.
2. Aspose.PDF for .NET: You’ll need to download and install the Aspose.PDF library. You can find the latest version [here](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/net/).
3. Development Environment: A suitable IDE like Visual Studio will make your life easier. Make sure you have it set up and ready to go.
4. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will help you understand the code snippets we’ll be using.
5. Sample PDF File: Have a sample PDF file ready for conversion. You can create one or download a sample from the internet.

## Import Packages

Now that we have our prerequisites sorted, let’s import the necessary packages. In your C# project, you’ll need to include the Aspose.PDF namespace. Here’s how you can do it:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Pdf;
```

This line of code allows you to access all the functionalities provided by the Aspose.PDF library.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Document Directory

First things first, you need to specify the path to your documents directory. This is where your input PDF file will be located and where the output XLS file will be saved. Here’s how you can do it:

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path on your machine. This is like setting the stage for your performance; everything needs to be in the right place!

## Step 2: Load the PDF Document

Now that we have our directory set up, it’s time to load the PDF document that we want to convert. This is where the magic begins! Use the following code:

```csharp
// Load PDF document
Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "input.pdf");
```

In this line, we’re creating a new instance of the `Document` class and passing the path of our PDF file. It’s like opening a book; you need to have it in front of you to read it!

## Step 3: Instantiate ExcelSave Options

Before we save our PDF as an XLS file, we need to specify the options for the Excel save operation. This is where you can customize how your data will be saved in Excel format. Here’s how to do it:

```csharp
// Instantiate ExcelSave Option object
Aspose.Pdf.ExcelSaveOptions excelsave = new ExcelSaveOptions();
```

By creating an instance of `ExcelSaveOptions`, you’re preparing the settings for your conversion. Think of it as choosing the right tools before starting a DIY project!

## Step 4: Save the Output in XLS Format

Finally, it’s time to save our PDF document as an XLS file. This is the moment we’ve all been waiting for! Use the following code:

```csharp
// Save the output in XLS format
pdfDocument.Save("PDFToXLS_out.xls", excelsave);
```

This line of code takes your loaded PDF and saves it as an XLS file named `PDFToXLS_out.xls`. It’s like hitting the “publish” button after working on a masterpiece!
