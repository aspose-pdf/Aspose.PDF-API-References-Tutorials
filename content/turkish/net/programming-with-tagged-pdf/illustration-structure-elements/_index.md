In this step-by-step guide, we are going to show you how to use illustration structure elements with Aspose.PDF for .NET. Aspose.PDF is a powerful library that lets you manipulate PDF documents programmatically. Illustration structure elements allow you to add images and figures to your PDF document, improving its visual presentation and understanding.

Let's dive into the code and learn how to use illustration structure elements with Aspose.PDF for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

1. Aspose.PDF library for .NET installed.
2. A basic knowledge of the C# programming language.

## Step 1: Setting up the environment

To get started, open your C# development environment and create a new project. Make sure you have added a reference to the Aspose.PDF library for .NET in your project.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";
```

## Step 2: Creating the document

The first step is to create a new PDF document using the `Document` class.

```csharp
// Create the PDF document
Document document = new Document();
```

## Step 3: Work with tagged content

Then we get the tagged content of the document to work with.

```csharp
// Get the tagged content of the document
ITaggedContent taggedContent = document.TaggedContent;
```

## Step 4: Set document title and language

We can now set the document title and language.

```csharp
// Define the document title and language
taggedContent.SetTitle("Tagged PDF document");
taggedContent.SetLanguage("fr-FR");
```

## Step 5: Add artwork

Now let's add illustrative elements, such as images and figures, to our document.

```csharp
// Underdevelopment
IllustrationElement figure1 = taggedContent.CreateFigureElement();
taggedContent.RootElement.AppendChild(figure1);
figure1.AlternativeText = "Figure One";
figure1.Title = "Picture 1";
figure1.SetTag("Fig1");
figure1.SetImage("image.png");
```

Here we create an illustration structure element, give it an alt text, title, custom tag, and associate an image with it.

## Step 6: Save the tagged PDF document

Finally, we save the tagged PDF document.

```csharp
// Save the tagged PDF document
document.Save(dataDir + "IllustrationStructureElements.pdf");
```

### Sample source code for Illustration Structure Elements using Aspose.PDF for .NET 
```csharp

// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";

// Create Pdf Document
Document document = new Document();

// Get Content for work with TaggedPdf
ITaggedContent taggedContent = document.TaggedContent;

// Set Title and Language for Documnet
taggedContent.SetTitle("Tagged Pdf Document");
taggedContent.SetLanguage("en-US");

// Under Development
IllustrationElement figure1 = taggedContent.CreateFigureElement();
taggedContent.RootElement.AppendChild(figure1);
figure1.AlternativeText = "Figure One";
figure1.Title = "Image 1";
figure1.SetTag("Fig1");
figure1.SetImage("image.png");

// Save Tagged Pdf Document
document.Save(dataDir + "IllustrationStructureElements.pdf");

```
