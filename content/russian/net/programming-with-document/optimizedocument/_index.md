To optimize the PDF document for the web, simply call the `Optimize` method.

```csharp
pdfDocument.Optimize();
```

## Step 4: Saving the Document

Finally, save the optimized document using the `Save` method.

```csharp
dataDir = dataDir + "OptimizeDocument_out.pdf";
pdfDocument.Save(dataDir);
```

By following this step-by-step guide, you can now easily optimize your PDF documents for the web using Aspose.PDF for .NET.
