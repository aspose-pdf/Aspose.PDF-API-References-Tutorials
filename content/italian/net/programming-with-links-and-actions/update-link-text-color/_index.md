Learn how to update the text color of links in PDF file using Aspose.PDF for .NET with this step-by-step guide.

## Step 1: Setting up the environment

Make sure you have set up your development environment with a C# project and the appropriate Aspose.PDF references.

## Step 2: Loading the PDF file

Set the directory path of your documents and upload the PDF file using the following code:

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENTS DIRECTORY";
// Load the PDF file
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "UpdateLinks.pdf");
```

## Step 3: Navigating Link Annotations

Loop through all the link annotations on the second page of the document using the following code:

```csharp
foreach(Annotation annotation in doc.Pages[1].Annotations)
{
     if (annotation is LinkAnnotation)
     {
         // Find the text under the annotation
         TextFragmentAbsorber ta = new TextFragmentAbsorber();
         Rectangle rect = annotation.Rect;
         rect.LLX -= 10;
         rect.LLY -= 10;
         rect.URX += 10;
         rect.URY += 10;
         ta.TextSearchOptions = new TextSearchOptions(rect);
         your.Visit(doc.Pages[1]);
         // Change text color.
         foreach(TextFragment tf in ta.TextFragments)
         {
             tf.TextState.ForegroundColor = Color.Red;
         }
     }
}
```

## Step 4: Save document with updated link text

Save the document with the updated link text using the `Save` method:

```csharp
dataDir = dataDir + "UpdateLinkTextColor_out.pdf";
doc.Save(dataDir);
```

## Step 5: Displaying the result

Display a message that the link annotation text color was updated successfully and specify the location of the saved file:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nText color of link annotations updated successfully.\nFile saved to location: " + dataDir);
```
