## Introduction

PDF files have become an integral part of our daily digital interactions, whether it’s for sharing reports, educational materials, or legal documents. With so much reliance on PDF formats, it’s essential to understand how to manipulate and customize them. One effective way to add a personal touch or to include necessary information is by stamping pages in a PDF. In this guide, we’ll walk you through the steps to add a PDF page stamp using Aspose.PDF for .NET. So buckle up! Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned developer, you’re in for a treat.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the nitty-gritty of adding a page stamp, let’s ensure you have everything you need. Here are the prerequisites for using Aspose.PDF for .NET effectively:

### .NET Framework
You should have the .NET Framework installed on your machine. Aspose.PDF supports .NET Core, .NET Framework, and more, so check their compatibility depending on your project.

### Aspose.PDF for .NET Library
You'll need to have the Aspose.PDF library set up in your development environment. You can [download it here](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/net/). 

### IDE
While you can use any text editor, it’s highly recommended to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio for an efficient coding experience.

### Basic Knowledge of C#
Since we’re dealing with C# snippets, a basic understanding of the language will go a long way in helping you follow along easily.

### PDF File
Have a sample PDF file handy, which you want to add a stamp to. We’ll refer to this as `PDFPageStamp.pdf`. 

## Import Packages 

Before we begin writing our code, we need to make sure we import the necessary packages required for the Aspose.PDF library. Here’s how to do it:

### Open Your Project
Launch your IDE, and open your existing project or create a new one.

### Import the Aspose.PDF Namespace
In your C# file, you should start by including the following using directive at the top:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using System;
using Aspose.Pdf;
```

These namespaces provide you with functionalities to manipulate PDF documents, including adding stamps.

Now that we have everything setup, let’s dive into the detailed steps of adding a PDF page stamp. We’ve broken down the process for clarity. 

## Step 1: Define the Document Directory

First things first, you need to set the path for the PDF documents. This variable will act as your directory for reading and saving files.

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
```

Replace `"YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY"` with the actual path to your directory.

## Step 2: Open the Existing PDF Document

Next, you’ll want to open the PDF file that you want to stamp. Using the `Document` class from Aspose.PDF, you can easily load your PDF.

```csharp
Document pdfDocument = new Document(dataDir + "PDFPageStamp.pdf");
```

Here, we are creating a new `Document` object and loading it with `PDFPageStamp.pdf`. Make sure the file is in the specified directory.

## Step 3: Create the Page Stamp

With the document in hand, it’s time to create a `PdfPageStamp`. This is the class responsible for adding stamps to specified pages in PDF documents.

```csharp
PdfPageStamp pageStamp = new PdfPageStamp(pdfDocument.Pages[1]);
```

Here we instantiated `pageStamp` and specified we want to apply it to the first page (indexing starts from 1).

## Step 4: Configure the Page Stamp Properties

To give your stamp the desired appearance, you can configure several properties:

- Background: This decides whether the stamp appears in the foreground or background.
- XIndent and YIndent: These determine the stamp’s placement on the page.
- Rotate: This defines the rotation angle of your stamp.

Here’s how you set these properties:

```csharp
pageStamp.Background = true; // True for background
pageStamp.XIndent = 100; // Set horizontal position
pageStamp.YIndent = 100; // Set vertical position
pageStamp.Rotate = Rotation.on180; // Rotate 180 degrees
```

Feel free to adjust the `XIndent` and `YIndent` values to place your stamp wherever you choose on the page.

## Step 5: Add the Stamp to the Page

This is the bread-and-butter moment; we need to apply the created stamp to the page.

```csharp
pdfDocument.Pages[1].AddStamp(pageStamp);
```

This command will add your newly configured stamp to the specified page.

## Step 6: Save the Document

After stamping, it’s time to save your newly stamped PDF document. 

```csharp
dataDir = dataDir + "PDFPageStamp_out.pdf"; // Output file path
pdfDocument.Save(dataDir); // Save the updated document
```

Now, the newly stamped PDF will be saved in the same directory with a new name, `PDFPageStamp_out.pdf`.

## Step 7: Confirmation Message

Adding a touch at the end, let's print a confirmation message to the console.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nPdf page stamp added successfully.\nFile saved at " + dataDir);
```

This line not only confirms the successful completion of your task but also provides the path where the stamped PDF is saved.

## Conclusion
