## Introduction

In the world of document management, PDFs reign supreme. They are the go-to format for sharing and preserving documents across various platforms. But what happens when you want to enhance your PDF documents with features like a Table of Contents (TOC)? That's where Aspose.PDF for .NET comes into play! This powerful library allows developers to manipulate PDF files with ease, enabling them to add, modify, and customize content effortlessly. In this tutorial, we will dive into how to customize page numbers while adding a TOC to your PDF documents using Aspose.PDF for .NET. So, grab your coding hat, and let’s get started!

## Prerequisites

Before we jump into the code, there are a few things you need to have in place:

1. Visual Studio: Ensure you have Visual Studio installed on your machine. This will be our development environment.
2. Aspose.PDF for .NET: You need to download and install the Aspose.PDF library. You can find it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/pdf/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming will help you understand the code snippets better.
4. A Sample PDF File: Have a sample PDF file ready that we can work with. You can create a simple one or download an existing PDF.

## Import Packages

To get started, we need to import the necessary packages. Open your Visual Studio project and add a reference to the Aspose.PDF library. You can do this by using NuGet Package Manager:

1. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
2. Select "Manage NuGet Packages."
3. Search for "Aspose.PDF" and install it.

```csharp
using Aspose.Pdf.Text;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```

Once you have the library installed, you can start coding!

## Step 1: Set Up Your Document Directory

First things first, we need to set up our document directory. This is where we will store our input and output PDF files. 

```csharp
string dataDir = "YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY";
string inFile = dataDir + "42824.pdf";
string outFile = dataDir + "42824_out.pdf";
```

In this snippet, replace `YOUR DOCUMENT DIRECTORY` with the actual path where your PDF files are located. This will help us load the existing PDF and save the modified version.

## Step 2: Load the Existing PDF File

Now that we have our document directory set up, let’s load the existing PDF file. 

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(inFile);
```

Here, we create a new `Document` object by passing the input file path. This allows us to manipulate the PDF content programmatically.

## Step 3: Insert a New Page for the TOC

Next, we need to create a new page in our PDF where the Table of Contents will reside.

```csharp
Aspose.Pdf.Page tocPage = doc.Pages.Insert(1);
```

This line inserts a new page at the beginning of the document. The TOC will be displayed on this page.

## Step 4: Create TOC Information

Now, let’s create an object to represent the TOC information.

```csharp
TocInfo tocInfo = new TocInfo();
TextFragment title = new TextFragment("Table Of Contents");
title.TextState.FontSize = 20;
title.TextState.FontStyle = FontStyles.Bold;
tocInfo.Title = title;
tocInfo.PageNumbersPrefix = "P";
tocPage.TocInfo = tocInfo;
```

In this step, we create a `TocInfo` object and set its title to "Table Of Contents." We also customize the font size and style. The `PageNumbersPrefix` is set to "P," which will prefix the page numbers in the TOC.

## Step 5: Add Headings to the TOC

Now comes the fun part! We will loop through the pages of the document and add headings to our TOC.

```csharp
for (int i = 1; i < doc.Pages.Count; i++)
{
    Aspose.Pdf.Heading heading2 = new Aspose.Pdf.Heading(1);
    TextSegment segment2 = new TextSegment();
    heading2.TocPage = tocPage;
    heading2.Segments.Add(segment2);
    heading2.DestinationPage = doc.Pages[i + 1];
    heading2.Top = doc.Pages[i + 1].Rect.Height;
    segment2.Text = "Page " + i.ToString();
    tocPage.Paragraphs.Add(heading2);
}
```

In this loop, we create a new `Heading` object for each page. We set the destination page for each heading and specify the text to display, which is "Page X" where X is the page number. Finally, we add the heading to the TOC page.

## Step 6: Save the Updated Document

After adding all the necessary headings, it’s time to save our updated document.

```csharp
doc.Save(outFile);
```

This line saves the modified PDF with the TOC included. You can now open the output file and see your customized Table of Contents!
